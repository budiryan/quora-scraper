"Answer": "In software engineering the pay can go as high as you want if your with the right company and have the talent and experience. If you\u2019re talking about a CEO that still writes code for his company, or a special case like a Google Fellow they make well into the million dollar range, but they are an extremely small percentage of the total developer population.If you are talking about the company that pays the most on average that would be Netflix. As far as I know there average salary for a senior software engineer at Netflix is 210K base salary, plus 20k cash bonus and close to 70K in stock. Which would bring total comp to over 300K. The average salary in the US for a senior level software engineer is a 110K and in San Francisco it\u2019s around 138K. I\u2019m not sure what cash and stock options are average for senior level engineers but, in tems of pure salary Netflix is paying more than it\u2019s competition.",

"Answer": "Depends on the TV, and the Computer.If your computer has an HDMI out, and it is *relatively* modern, there is likely also an HD audio driver installed that will push sound as well as video through the HDMI. That would mean that any TV with an HDMI connection on it, would only require an HDMI cable between the TV and the computer, to get video and sound. That\u2019s what HDMI was made for.But\u2026 some of the older computers that first came with HDMI, didn\u2019t do sound over the cable. For those, your TV would have to have additional audio inputs\u2026 little red and white metal donut nubs somewhere on the back of your TV marked as INPUTS. RCA audio connectors. You\u2019d need to obtain a 3.5mm stereo to RCA cable\u2026 that is one that would have a headphone plug on one end, and those funny looking red and white plugs on the other. You would then connect that between the headphone jack on the laptop, and the audio input on the television.Now, if your TV only has a VGA or D-Sub input, then you would DEFINITELY need that audio cable between the headphone jack on the laptop and the audio inputs on the television, since VGA doesn\u2019t do sound. But for VGA, you\u2019d either need a laptop with a VGA output, or you\u2019d need some type of converter/adapter.Going from VGA to HDMI\u2026 analog to Digital, that requires a powered converter box. If the laptop only has VGA, and the TV only has HDMI, then this is going to be what you need, and they aren\u2019t necessarily cheap. If you are going from HDMI on the laptop, to VGA on the TV? That\u2019s cheap. That\u2019s Digital to Analog, and those are just adapters.If your laptop has DVI and the TV has HDMI? That\u2019s a straight Digital to Digital adapter. You\u2019d have to use the extra audio cable from the laptop though.",

"Answer": "If you have a HDMI cable it will output both video and audio from the computer to the TV.If you are using VGA you will only output video. In this case you will need to check if your TV has a 3.5mm audio input port. If so you can connect the appropriate cable from your computer's output audio port (where you plug your headphones in) into your TVs audio input port. Btw, you can do this without VGA if all you want is sound and no video",

"Answer": "I\u2019m not a fan of competitions where art is a big factor (and it should be here, not just for your learning and doing, but also to carry with you later).And \u2026 it\u2019s usually much much better to do things that really intrigue you that also push into computing \u201cjust because\u201d. When something good happens, you might also have a candidate for a science fair.An experience that made a big impression on me when I was still a student but a bit older than you, was to come in contact with some of the fundamental relationships that have to do with programming. In my case, there were a number of these \u2014 two biggies were \u201cMeta II\u201d by Val Schorre, and Lisp 1.5 (page 13) by John McCarthy. Both of these were tiny (~ 30 lines of code) self-definitions of systems that had an enormous amount of expressive power (the former was a self-bootstrapping compiler-compiler, the latter was \u201cThe Maxwell\u2019s Equations of Programming\u201d in a tiny, cosmically powerful programming language).The process is to understand the self-definition, and then re-write it in some recursive language (could be something like Python, etc.) and this would produce the system like magic. (In practice there is a little more code needed around the kernel, but not a lot.)You should be able to find both of these references online (I found them for you (below)). Both of them are good science fair projects because they require some work and also a good explanation/poster by the student.They are also a gateway into the kinds of advanced thinking about computing that most people who learn programming never get to.Good Luck.John McCarthy et al Lisp 1.5 Manual (ca 1962)http://www.softwarepreservation....Val Schorre Meta II Paper (1964)https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&...",

"Answer": "Can the following video be accomplished in the proscribed time or even tougher be accomplished without nested loops? There are many capacities that computers can perform quickly, systematically, and perfectly such as finding the shortest route for travel, complex calculations and spell checking. There are some tasks that computers execute and handle well, although not perfectly, such as algorithms for strategy games -- Go or Chess. It almost goes with slight thought that computers will triumph against a human and even more so in virtually any mathematical contest a computer would dominate. But, just how competitive would a computer program be at this mathematical challenge against a person? Here is a captivating example of the contest from YouTube:. ------ It involves two cards being chosen randomly that will have a number within the range of 1 \u2013 10 and 4 cards selected that will likewise have a number from 11-100, and then last a target number chosen at random between 500 - 1000. Using elementary math operations: +, -, /, *, exponents, and factorials in conjunction with the six random numbers in attempting to come as close as possible to the target number, each number may only be used once. There was a time limit of 30 seconds in which the contestants had to deliberate. Is that enough time for a computer program to determine the right combination and sequence of numbers/operators to contend? But, with this problem, there isn\u2019t an explicit path for matching the target number; could this be an AI type of problem? How could this be coded because it seems like it would just be pure guessing, but it does appear with humans there is a strategy?",

"Answer": "My bias opinion would be hockey. I have played sports on a competitive level all my life including basketball, rugby, football (american), hockey, volleyball, golf, tennis, swimming and many more. Hockey is by far the toughest sport, skill wise and physically, I participated in. Here\u2019s why:SkatingHockey is extremely physical. It takes a lot of training to be able to play at a high level.For a robot to play hockey, it will have to be designed and programmed to be able to balance while skating, making sharp turns and pivots, accelerate or decelerate while responding to its opponents, and being in position both offensively and defensively.For a robot to skate, it will need legs very similar to the human anatomy. It will need to be engineered very innovatively since robots can hardly walk at the same level as humans.Body checkingHockey is the only sport that allows fighting; so we all know how physical this sport is. The robot hockey player will need to be programmed to recognize when and how hard to hit a player, how to take a hit, how to avoid being hit, and when it would be better to hit someone or stick check someone.Offense and DefenseHockey is an extremely fast paced game. Anything can happen within a millisecond. The robot will have to be able to recognize opportunities on offence, where to be in position, and how to fore check. Not only that, the robot will have to improvise and anticipate what his teammates are thinking.On defense the robot will have to play positioning once again. But, unlike basketball, there is no one person who is your check. The robot will have to be able to improvise and recognize what the opposing team will be trying to do.It\u2019s hard enough for a human to recognize and anticipate opportunities.Now let\u2019s throw in a hockey stickStick handlingthrow in a hockey stick and the robot will have to be programmed to have stick handling skills. Maneuvering with a stick while having a puck is not easy when you are up against elite level players. The robot will have to have innovative technologies that will enable the wrist action while stick handling; it is not just a back and forth movement. The robot will need to be able to stick handle with one hand and two hands with endless possibilities of dekes and puck handling techniques.PassesWe will need to add in some sensors and actuators for the robot to receive passes and sense the speed of incoming passes. if the stick is held too tight, the puck will bounce off the blade and the puck will be lost. The easiest part will be to program the robot to pass the puck to players who are moving. However, the robot again needs to anticipate where their teammates will be within milliseconds.Shootingshooting will also involve wrist movement and body maneuvers. For a wrist shot, the puck starts at the heel of the stick, and with the wrist movement it will roll through the nose of the blade(the end) and flick off. Add this with the high skating speed the robot will need to be able to adjust its shot according to its speed and distance away from the net. Furthermore the robot will have to be programmed to lift the puck a certain height. There is also the slap shot, snap shot, and backhand which all have its own techniques that the robot will have to be designed and programmed to implement..I think the hardest thing about designing a robot hockey player would be to design the robot to skate effectively and efficiently while performing 5 different tasks at the same timeThere\u2019s a lot more to the game than just these but you can see how complicated it is getting already. I\u2019ve only touched on the surface and dove into the bare minimum",

"Answer": "Obviously not golf, since golf-playing robot already exists, and is quite good: google LDRIC. But that's hardly surprising - golf uses a very narrow range of motion compared to most sports; a legless person can play it. Note that LDRIC has no legs.And this brings up an obvious question - does the robot have to look like a human? Bipedal locomotion is one of the hardest problems in robotics, and no bipedal robot yet has agility even close to that of a human athlete (although some models are already better than a couch potato). Remove the requirement for legs, and a tennis-playing robot on wheels should be pretty straightforward. And with sufficiently powerful motors and brakes, such robot would wipe out the best human player.But if you insist for a robot to look and move like a human, then any sport with a lot of jumping and ball-catching will be a bitch. Especially if you also insist that the robot has human-like hands, poorly suited for catching bouncy objects. I think basketball would be worst.",

"Answer": "Few years back I have very faded concept of cloud computing like \u201c It gives an access from wherever we want; easy accessibility.\u201d The days passed on I started to gather more knowledge about it. Cloud Computing is definitely for anywhere access but not only for that , it has vast feature when it comes to IT, Software, SaaS and Paas , Security etc.Here I have included a blog from IBM which I had read during 2014, it is still very much relevant till date.Cloud computing has been credited with increasing competitiveness through cost reduction, greater flexibility, elasticity and optimal resource utilization. Here are a few situations where cloud computing is used to enhance the ability to achieve business goals.1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS)When it comes to IaaS, using an existing infrastructure on a pay-per-use scheme seems to be an obvious choice for companies saving on the cost of investing to acquire, manage and maintain an IT infrastructure. There are also instances where organizations turn to PaaS for the same reasons while also seeking to increase the speed of development on a ready-to-use platform to deploy applications.2. Private cloud and hybrid cloudAmong the many incentives for using cloud, there are two situations where organizations are looking into ways to assess some of the applications they intend to deploy into their environment through the use of a cloud (specifically a public cloud). While in the case of test and development it may be limited in time, adopting a hybrid cloud approach allows for testing application workloads, therefore providing the comfort of an environment without the initial investment that might have been rendered useless should the workload testing fail.Another use of hybrid cloud is also the ability to expand during periods of limited peak usage, which is often preferable to hosting a large infrastructure that might seldom be of use. An organization would seek to have the additional capacity and availability of an environment when needed on a pay-as you-go basis.3. Test and developmentProbably the best scenario for the use of a cloud is a test and development environment. This entails securing a budget, setting up your environment through physical assets, significant manpower and time. Then comes the installation and configuration of your platform. All this can often extend the time it takes for a project to be completed and stretch your milestones.With cloud computing, there are now readily available environments tailored for your needs at your fingertips. This often combines, but is not limited to, automated provisioning of physical and virtualized resources.4. Big data analyticsOne of the aspects offered by leveraging cloud computing is the ability to tap into vast quantities of both structured and unstructured data to harness the benefit of extracting business value.Retailers and suppliers are now extracting information derived from consumers\u2019 buying patterns to target their advertising and marketing campaigns to a particular segment of the population. Social networking platforms are now providing the basis for analytics on behavioral patterns that organizations are using to derive meaningful information.5. File storageCloud can offer you the possibility of storing your files and accessing, storing and retrieving them from any web-enabled interface. The web services interfaces are usually simple. At any time and place you have high availability, speed, scalability and security for your environment. In this scenario, organizations are only paying for the amount of storage they are actually consuming, and do so without the worries of overseeing the daily maintenance of the storage infrastructure.There is also the possibility to store the data either on or off premises depending on the regulatory compliance requirements. Data is stored in virtualized pools of storage hosted by a third party based on the customer specification requirements.6. Disaster recoveryThis is yet another benefit derived from using cloud based on the cost effectiveness of a disaster recovery (DR) solution that provides for a faster recovery from a mesh of different physical locations at a much lower cost that the traditional DR site with fixed assets, rigid procedures and a much higher cost.7. BackupBacking up data has always been a complex and time-consuming operation. This included maintaining a set of tapes or drives, manually collecting them and dispatching them to a backup facility with all the inherent problems that might happen in between the originating and the backup site. This way of ensuring a backup is performed is not immune to problems such as running out of backup media , and there is also time to load the backup devices for a restore operation, which takes time and is prone to malfunctions and human errors.Cloud-based backup, while not being the panacea, is certainly a far cry from what it used to be. You can now automatically dispatch data to any location across the wire with the assurance that neither security, availability nor capacity are issues.While the list of the above uses of cloud computing is not exhaustive, it certainly give an incentive to use the cloud when comparing to more traditional alternatives to increase IT infrastructure flexibility , as well as leverage on big data analytics and mobile computing.Remember, I work for Cloud CRM : ConvergeHub : Give it check if you want >>>http://www.convergehub.com/CRM-S...",

"Answer": "Great question!The best thing you can do for yourself as a freshmen interested in AI and ML is to make sure you lay a solid foundation in the required math and computer science prerequisites to deeply understanding AI and ML ideas.From an academic perspective, this means that you should make sure you sign up for a linear algebra course, discrete math and probability course, and a multivariable calculus course. You should also make sure you take a good introduction to programming course as well as a data structures and algorithms course. All of these courses are incredibly important in AI and ML because the concepts you learn from these courses will show up over and over again in a variety of applications.If your undergraduate courses offer the chance, see if you can take a version of the math courses that also show the applications of these subjects to solving real world problems. Personally, I found that my understanding of linear algebra for example was a lot better because the course I learned linear algebra in was an Electrical Engineering course that taught the fundamentals of the field and showed direct applications of the theory. For example, when we learned about eigenvalues, we learned it in the context of understanding the PageRank algorithm and steady states. When we learned Singular Value Decomposition, we learned in the context of dimensionality reduction in the Principal Component Analysis algorithm. In my experience, a lot of people find it hard to understand these math subjects because they are often introduced without the context of an application. If you don\u2019t get this opportunity, whenever you learn something in your math classes, always ask yourself why it works and why it is useful. The why it is useful part will often lead to some independent research where you will encounter actual applications of abstract concepts you learn.Now once you have gone through the proper chain of math to understand the topics in AI and ML, the best thing you can do is just dive into it. Start reading through some AI and ML algorithms and try to implement them. Read through some of the recent research work published in top tier conferences such as NIPS and ICLR. Then see if you can synthesize your knowledge into a problem you want to try attack using AI and ML and see if you can build something. Even if none of this is successful, you will learn a lot more from doing this than passively watching AI and ML tutorials, which is what a lot of people trying to learn AI and ML do. Watching these tutorials is not a bad idea, but always make sure that you portion a decent amount of time towards actively learning things through implementation and building things.",

"Answer": "It many application and network programming frameworks the fundamental design of a program written to utilize the framework, is around the concept of an event loop.Conceptually such code provides hooks, that is places where their code will call into your code, for things like configuration, initialization, adding UI (user interface) elements or I/O channels (open files, networking sockets) etc. Each of these elements and channels can be associated with their own events. Any GUI (graphical UI) element could have the mouse moved over it, hovered over it, move away from it, be clicked on or double or triple clicked, etc. Menus can be clicked on, radios and check boxes can be set or cleared, text areas can have texted edited, etc. Any I/O channel could have more data input, a buffer full or empty, or some out-of-band event (errors, end-of-file).Once the programmer has built up all these elements and channels then the event loop is called and the various callbacks are called as events come in. (Some event loops also implement polling of various non-event driven interfaces and devices).Your code is called by the event loop. Typically it does the work, but it can also add (and remove and modify) UI elements and I/O channels.Also it\u2019s possible for programmers to design their own programs around the event loop paradigm even if they\u2019re not using a programming framework designed for this purpose. For example many programs in Unix are written around the select system call, or one of its more advanced alternatives for asynchronous I/O. Here\u2019s an article on that: select / poll / epoll: practical difference for system architectsFor Python almost all work in the Twisted framework will involved their event loop. The same is true of Node.js. It\u2019s also true of many GUI frameworks.",

"Answer": "An event loop is often times the \u201cmain\u201d of a program that handles events. If you have written a program you know that it will exit when it is done. Programs that run indefinitely like UI applications, video games, web servers, etc will have some form of an event loop. They can come in different flavors such as being a polling loop (check if there is an event every time it loops) or it can be handled via blocks and something triggers it to come and do it's job.For instance, imagine you have a program running a UI. If it's idle and you look at your running processes it's likely not going to be eating up a ton of processing time by continually looping. It can either be utterly silent or it may be taking up a fraction of a percent of the CPUs time. But if you go and hit a button the program is going to wake up and do something. This is ran by an event loop. Clicking that button fired an event which got processed by the event loop which called the buttons onClick event handler.They're fairly primitive, but they're highly useful.",

"Answer": "Andrew Ng's course on Coursera explains this well. I hope to correctly capture the details but I am confident in the applications presented below.Batch refers to how training samples are used while computing the loss function. It is distinct from \u201conline\u201d and \u201cmini-batch\u201d learning.When training a model, each example in the data set is presented as input to the model with some weights. The performance is evaluated using a loss function over all of the training samples. Then an optimization function will update the model weights based on the loss function. This is repeated for every \u201cepoch\u201d which is usually a tunable parameter set by the programmer.In \u201cbatch\u201d learning the whole training set is used to compute the current model performance in the loss function. This can be infeasible for large data sets so \u201cmini-batch\u201d may be used instead, computing the loss function over a chunk or subset of the data. This perhaps would suggest that \u201cbatch\u201d may not have been the best choice of nomenclature. There is also \u201conline\u201d learning where each sample is evaluated one at a time and the weights are updated with each sample. This is more well suited for streaming applications and detecting trends.",

With that being said, it is also quite broad and encapsulates several sub-fields that commonly are lumped into two camps: Theory A [Algorithm and Complexity] and Theory B [Formal Models and Semantics], so I\u2019ll paraphrase a blog that does a good job breaking it down: Theory A and Theory B.I tend to prefer just being specific about which area of TCS being referred to as specifically. Now Theory A and Theory B tend to be broken into several subfields, by no means is the Wikipedia article a complete list but it is also recommended: Theoretical computer science - Wikipedia (the table in that section is pretty accurate for the \u201cmain areas\u201d, though not perfect; some may include Natural Computing if Quantum Computing is included).We research the mathematical aspects of computation. Normally our work is theoretic, so normally our work requires mathematical rigour. Computation is naturally described mathematically, which serves as a fundamental backbone to Computer Science. Hence, it makes sense to study computation in this way.Usually theoreticians work on mathematical proofs, sometimes write programs, but fundamentally the goal is to further our understanding of the nature of computation through the design of new algorithms, the development of better models, and proving new theorems that place the problems we study within the larger computational complexity landscape.",

Page has given an excellent answer, so I will give an early example.During WW2, Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park were aware that the method they were using to decrypt Enigma messages relied on the fact that the Germans were misusing the machine; the Germans put the message key twice at the front of each message. One day they knew that the Germans would realise this was compromising message security and would drop the repeat.Fortunately, Bletchley had accumulated a huge repository of decoded messages, and could see that many of them were formulaic and often contained strings of characters that could be used a cribs. After a lot of thought, Turing was able to devise a system and a new machine (or bombe) that used a crib to break a message. The bombe would systematically check all the combinations, and stop when it found a potential match.Most of us would have sat back at this point and taken a rest, but here\u2019s where the computer science comes in. Turing was aware that the bombe would make several false stops before hitting upon the correct message, and before the first one was even made, he was able to calculate how many false stops could be expected before it reached the right key!Now that is pure computer science!",

"Answer": "Modern drives come with just one big physical partition, but there was a time when disk drives had physical partitions. However, a technique was developed which allowed a physical partition to be divided into sub-partitions which behaved logically like physical partitions. The word \u201clogical\u201d was chosen to describe them because the word arose naturally in an attempt to describe their nature.The choice of \u201clogical\u201d in your other example is slightly more arbitrary. Something like \u201cvirtual\u201d or \u201cpseudo\u201d would have worked as well. It is like the real thing, but not quite the real thing.",

In TCP/IP, the protocol used for communications on the Internet and most modern computer networks, the \u201cname\u201d of any host isn\u2019t actually sent in any of the IP communications. DNS is essentially just a lookup table/dictionary.There are some applications, such as HTTP, which will send the name in the application payload, because in modern web systems its used to determine which web page you want (a single host, with a single IP can serve multiple websites). There are other protocols such as SIP and more which may make use of the DNS name. So in some cases, substituting the IP address anywhere you would normally have the name, will not work.",

For anyone who doesn't know what that project is, you can find a brief synopsis on my profile under \u201ccurrent research\u201d. I basically got assigned to it as part of the National Science Foundation\u2019s Enriched Doctoral Training program. [1]The professors on the project use MATLAB mainly, so I\u2019ve had to do pretty much everything in MATLAB.I was working on more traditional methods and I found that they just weren't sufficient. I'll skip over why they weren't sufficient to save your eyes from rolling back into your head out of boredom.I needed something capable of extracting patterns in individual patient anatomy. I had heard the term \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, but didn't really know what it was, so I started exploring. As a general rule, when learning something new, I want to get a quick overview of the entire field so when I don't know something, I at least know where to look. That's why I watched Andrew Ng\u2019s Coursera course. I had a solid math background and a busy schedule the next day, so I watched it at 2x speed the whole way. I definitely recommend the course, but wouldn't recommend watching it at 2x speed unless you're absolutely sure he won't mention any math you aren't 100% comfortable with.That night, I prototyped a few basic algorithms in MATLAB for the reconstruction and found pretty much exactly what I had expected\u2026 they all had way too much bias. I decided I needed a neural network. So I downloaded MatConvNet and started building a model. I screwed up a lot, going down a lot of wrong paths, reading papers that turned out not to be relevant at all. That's what taught me the most. Every time I wanted to test an idea, I had to implement it, see what went wrong, and figure out how to fix it. That meant plenty of reading, experimenting, and passing out at my computer at 6 AM.Lots and lots of false paths. None of them will help in finishing this research, but I learned something from all of them and that has helped me with answering questions on Quora and will help me immensely in future projects.I've learned a lot from reading answers on Quora as well as from writing them.As for what I'm doing next, I have a few more theoretical research problems I want to look into listed on my profile and there are others not listed too. Beyond that, I'm not sure\u2026Conner Davis\u2019 three-step guide to learning MLDisclaimer: this is what I did and it worked really well for me, but I don't have much basis for comparison and I have no idea if it'll work for you.Along the way you'll be reading papers, Quora answers, Wikipedia articles, and lots of documentation. You\u2019ll learn a lot while getting tangible results.",

"Answer": "\u201cI have a feeling\u2026\u201dStop right there.This is something you could measure, and then reason about given the data. Get a decent compiler, turn up optimization and warnings to a decent level, and try multiple coding approaches.Now, compile each of the approaches for your target architecture.Then, measure the size, speed, or whatever other metrics you care about.Now, come back to the same code six months later and try to make some non-trivial changes to each of them, and consider how brittle (or not) each version is.You might find that the goto-containing version is a little faster or smaller in some cases, but less easy to reason about, modify, and maintain. Or, maybe contrary to your intuition, the goto-containing code turned out larger and/or slower. Compilers can sometimes be surprising.I don\u2019t automatically think goto is bad. There are some places where it really is the best answer. They are few and far between. Because I write C code in an embedded environment, I write maybe one or two goto statements per year. They likely fall into one of two categories: \u201cerror exit cleanup path\u201d or \u201cbreaking out of a multiple loop nest.\u201dI\u2019ve also found that too much cleverness up front in pursuit of some perceived performance benefit is often a waste of time. Either the gain isn\u2019t measurable, or it\u2019s measurable but slight. When compared to the maintenance cost, it often isn\u2019t worth it.In the end, there\u2019s no substitution for measurement.",

"Answer": "If you're programming in Assembly, any processor, you will use branches or jumps or whatever the equivalent is in that instruction set.If you're programming in C or a similar procedural language, there are certain rare exceptions where it makes sense. In every one of them, the target of the goto is in the same function and is usually at a higher line number than the goto. The best of these exceptions is to use goto to implement exception handling in a language that doesn't support it.If you're programming in an object oriented language with native exception handling, you should not use goto without a very very good reason that is well documented in the code. I've yet to see a case of this that passes the sniff test in a couple of decades of experience.You claim that the code with gotos is faster. With certain rare exceptions, the compiler is better at optimizing than you are. You should instead focus on making your code as easy to understand as possible. If you think you're being clever, chances are your code is too hard to maintain and you should rethink your approach. Before anyone gets worked up, this does not apply to algorithms; improving big O performance is one of the few places you can meaningfully optimize.",

"Answer": "You can\u2019t write assembly language programs without putting in a few unconditional jumps. That\u2019s the way they work.But for high level languages, I don\u2019t know of any modern languages that actually have a goto statement in them. If the goto isn\u2019t there, then your question is moot, because you can\u2019t use a construct that\u2019s not present in the language.However, to address your particular point. Yes, there can be circumstances where a goto apparently saves a variable or ostensibly makes the code cleaner, but No, you shouldn\u2019t use it. As Kernighan and Ritchie put it, the goto is infinitely abusable. It\u2019s not a habit you want to get into. Most programmers, including yours truly, don\u2019t know when to stop. It starts out with the occasional goto here and there, but after a while you end up with 20000 lines of spaghetti, but lacking the delicious tomato sauce. The safest option is to go completely cold turkey on it. It may lead to some short term inefficiencies, but in the long term it\u2019s better for the project.For me, that ban also includes goto substitutes such as break statements used outside switches, continue statements, and multiple return statements. In Java, I even hate having more than one System.exit() in the code, but I will sometimes compromise my standards on this.",

When interviewing a candidate, an obsession with algorithms screams \u201cI have no experience at all\u201d.Algorithms have the advantage of not requiring you to know anything about the domain. They usually work on numbers, or strings. Did it ever occur to you that it\u2019s really, really not interesting to be able to find a number you already know in a data structure? I mean, who cares? Only CS students, because they don\u2019t have anything better to care about.The correct answer to \u201cHow do you implement a red-black tree in Java?\u201d is \u201cuh\u2026 google it on stack overflow\u201d or \u201ccheck Wikipedia\u201d. I suppose it might vaguely interest me if you remember what the advantage is over other kinds of structures (but only if you can also tell me what the disadvantages are). But I\u2019d much rather you know that the implementation is best left to somebody else\u2019s pre-debugged library. (Evaluating which libraries are good, however, is an art that will come with experience.)Good software developers aren\u2019t \u201cweak\u201d on algorithms. They\u2019ve just gotten over it. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s important. Because it isn\u2019t. Algorithms are the kind of thing implemented by one person. Good developers know that very little real work is done by one person. They emphasize teamwork, and the software development practices that go into it.It\u2019s like a third grader asking why physicists use calculators, and can\u2019t do long division quickly any more. The third grader can only do long division, because they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing long division. And you have to learn it\u2026 but only so that you can go on to more important things.Algorithms are for n00bs. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a n00b: we were all n00bs once. N00bs may go on to be good at it. But n00bs who insist that n00bie things are the important things will forever remain n00bs.

"Answer": "Because most software development work does not require in-depth knowledge of data structures and algorithm. By \u201cin-depth\u201d knowledge, I mean, for example, being able to implement your own Hashset<T> or map<TKey, TValue> or max heap, and get the same reliability and performance characteristics you can get from the C++ standard library or the .NET framework.What you \u201cdo\u201d need to be able to do is realize which of the data structures and algorithms (implemented by someone else in a generic/template) way are best for a particular problem you are trying to solve \u2014 both from an ease of coding and a performance perspective. Good software developers are for the most part expert consumers of data structures and algorithms rather than expert producers of data structures and algorithms.Sure, I\u2019ve done my own Red-Tree for shits and giggles. It took me forever and I\u2019d never use it in production code. But I\u2019m able to pick the right data structures and algorithms to produce useful software reliably. That\u2019s what I get paid to do.I actually enjoy working on library type stuff. But, most of the time, someone else has already done it \u2014 doing it yourself again when its already a known-good is a waste of time.",

"Answer": "CS is a very popular major at Dartmouth and we apparently have one of the best CS departments within the Ivy League. A fun fact would be that Dartmouth is the birthplace of A.I., a pretty important milestone in the history of CS if you ask me. But I definitely am biased.If I were you, I would base my decision more on financial and social factors. Ivy League schools are private schools and VERY expensive (with many need based financial aid packages). UCSD, on the other hand, is a state school and more affordable. If your college choice is not limited by financial factors, I would consider location and social life.I fell in love with Dartmouth\u2019s campus and it was my first choice, but this is a highly subjective decision. I really enjoyed skiing in the winter and going on hikes and kayaking trips. Columbia would offer totally contrasting NYC resources that you might think are more compelling than the New Hampshire natural landscape, so if I were you, I would definitely base my decision on these factors. All of these schools have strong CS programs so you can't go wrong with these choices.",

"Answer": "Straight from this article:I returns its argument:Ix = xK, when applied to any argument x, yields a one-argument constant function Kx , which, when applied to any argument, returns x:Kxy = xS is a substitution operator. It takes three arguments and then returns the first argument applied to the third, which is then applied to the result of the second argument applied to the third. More clearly:Sxyz = xz(yz)So here are three different combinators. I does nothing, but return what you pass to it, K takes two arguments and returns the first as the result, and S takes three arguments, takes the first one, applies it to the third, and then applies the result of it to the result of second applied to third.Let\u2019s see how these three combinators can reverse a pair of symbols.S(K(SI))K\u03b1\u03b2This expression will reverse the \u03b1\u03b2 that was passed as arguments. We first evaluate the leftmost S by applying K(SI) to \u03b1, which are the first and third arguments of first S, and then applying the result of it to the result of K\u03b1:K(SI)\u03b1(K\u03b1)\u03b2Now we evaluate the left K(SI)\u03b1, which gives us the SI, as can be seen from the definition. Regardless of y, which is in this case \u03b1, K will return x, which is SI:SI(K\u03b1)\u03b2Ok, we are definitely getting somewhere here. So now we evaluate the left S. It has the arguments I, K\u03b1, \u03b2, so it applies I to \u03b2, and applies it to the result of applying K\u03b1 to \u03b2:I\u03b2(K\u03b1\u03b2)Evaluate the left I we get just \u03b2 and the right K\u03b1\u03b2 returns \u03b1, so we get our reversed expression\u03b2\u03b1Overall, not very productive, but here you go.",

This implies failures rates overall scale to the time the computer is on. A computer that is turned on and off once per day should be twice reliable as on that is left running continuousely. Even so, common wisdom is that turning a computer on and off daily is not as good for it as leaving it on continuously. Pros and Cons of Leaving Your Computer Turned On All the TimeReading that article, I am reminded that household transients (air conditioning, furnace, dryer, external surges etc) are a frequent cause of computer failure. Solution: spring for a surge protector if you leave one running continuously.Further, running a distributed computing task on a computer that is running anyway should have not effect on its reliability or life.",

"Answer": "Maybe yes, maybe no. If it encourages you to leave your PC on all the time, it may actually increase the lifespan. A lot of the wear and tear to computers comes in the form of expansion and contraction of components as they heat up and cool down. Keeping them running at a more-constant level of usage keeps them at a more consistent temperature.For mechanical hard drives, the main wear and tear happens when spinning up and spinning down\u2026 so again, having them running on a more regular basis may increase their lifespans.In any case, the MTBF (mean time between failure) of modern computer components is on the order of 25 years or more. Even if running such software shortened lifespan by, say, 25%, what\u2019s the actual chance that you\u2019ll still be using the same computer in 10 years, much less 20?",

"Answer": "Maybe. The major factor in CPU life is heat. The failure rate for a CPU doubles with every 10C above 25C. A CPU at idle still puts out a lot of heat. A CPU used in distributed processing is probably nowhere near 100% capacity. So distributed processing would decrease life but only slightly. A CPU at 100% usage continuously can easily last 10 years. In that amount of time many people have replaced their computer twice.",

"Answer": "I hope not.It may well be possible, given the leaps by which these fields have grown.But justice is a very \u2018human\u2019 concept.One may argue that putting machines in charge of the exercise of law would make the whole process \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018transparent\u2019.My counter-argument is that Justice and Law matter precisely because humans administer them.An entity that is not subject to any biological limitations would probably find it difficult to grasp the concepts of nuance, of extenuating circumstances, of desperation and passion .How would an AI algorithm quantify the victim\u2019s poverty or affluence and its effect on the commission of the crime and the appropriate punishment?How would it account for the severity of a crime, the amount of violence inflicted, the mental state of the perpetrator(s)?Would the quantum of punishment change if the victim belonged to an exploited class? Would it change due to the victim\u2019s sex or age?Machine learning depends on the analysis of very large data sets, which it uses to evolve its own algorithms and methods of analysis.But ultimately GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) still applies.In a world, where the victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 social status, wealth and attractiveness (yes, physical attractiveness) often decide the outcome of the case, how would we prevent such inherent inequity from creeping into the AI, which is using those very cases as its input?As far as I know, we cannot program machines for empathy (whether empathy arises from the machines\u2019 themselves as a higher order consequence of their programming is an interesting ponderable, but then such a machine might also have the latent capacity for sociopathy and psychosis). Our mortality and empathy are in my opinion, the basis on which our entire understanding of justice and fairness are based.There is also the question of moral responsibility.How do you hold a machine accountable for a miscarriage of justice?What higher authority do you approach if you recieve unfavorable judgement?What moral authority does an AI have? What moral authority do human judges dependent on an AI to do the heavy lifting have to pass sentence upon you?Plenty of food for thought.Thank you for the A2A.",

To do this in real time is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and processing power. So your best bet is to have the engine constantly visiting sites and building an index of their contents. Then, when someone uses your engine to query a specific search string, you match that against your index and return the best-matching results. For a short selection you could then even reindex in real time, weeding out false positives, sites that are currently down or that have changed.You better have a fast indexing and retrieval mechanism and loads of storage and computing power.",

Eventually, it loads up all of the text from all of the websites from\u2026maybe 80% of the websites on the planet.This would take an eternity for a single PC - but the search engine guys have massive server farms with vast, high speed networks and mountains of disk space.Once you have that stuff loaded - presumably onto a few thousand hard disk drives - you can now consider how to search it. In theory, you could take the words that the user typed in - and look though the thousands of hard drives to see which websites contain them.But this would take another eternity.So you have to build an index\u2026you could make a list of all the words in the English (and other) languages - and against each one, make a list of all of the websites that use that word.

"Answer": "Okay. First things first, it's a huge task,and C is not the best tool to do it. I'm implementing this right now using Python and Go. My idea is that you have to build a database that fits all that data. Then you write a crawler. Mine access a page,get all the links in it,and pool them to be accessed next. I only index the name and the URL(the content would take too much space).Then I go around accessing every link. Creating my own(tiny) map of the web. Good luck with your project,but please,do not lock yourself to C. It's a good language for a lot of things. This is not one of them,at least for me.",

"Answer": "I don\u2019t think these sort of questions can really have an answer unless someone has attended both programs. Your only source of *scientific* and *logical* data are the statistics online like what percentage of NEU grads gets a job within a year of graduation etc. However, I believe these numbers are extremely stupid and useless as well. One thing I can tell you is that in 2017, going to a specific school doesn\u2019t get you a job. All the schools more or less present the same material, It is more important what you do with this knowledge. Do you just try to pass your classes or do cool projects on your own, do internships, do research on your free time?These statistics on what percentage of students get a good job depends fully on the student profile and just a tiny bit on the school itself.In the past 4 years I have experienced myself and my friends land jobs at the best Tech companies while our close friends from MIT, Harvard, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon couldn\u2019t even get through the first round of the interviews. Does this mean these schools are bad ? No. Does this mean Northeastern is a good school? No.There is a good chance that in tech industry someone will no diploma, who only graduated high school can get a job instead of you. It is all about what you do with the knowledge.Another important point is that there are millions of open jobs in CS. Unless you turn out to be a really bad students, there isn\u2019t a single reason why you couldn\u2019t get *a* job when you graduate. And most of these companies provide sponsorships to international students so\u2026 But if you want to get a *great* job, again it is all about what you do in the next 4/5 years.One other thing I can say about Northeastern is that the COOP program definitely helps you get a job after graduation. If you do a good job on your COOP, the companies will tend to make you a return offer.",

"Answer": "You have to define mastery. People indirectly suggest that mastery is not possible. I disagree. Mastery is not the same as perfection. The concept of perfection is rigid and if you achieve perfection, you have no room to grow and no reason to do more. Instead, mastery of a programming environment is about delivering the goods, as an individual, that exceeds the capabilities of most people. That also suggests that not everyone will achieve mastery. The uncommon nature of mastery does not negate its existence.Although he may humbly digress, I would consider Dr. Donald Knuth to have master computer programming. That does not suggest he is incapable of making mistakes. On the contrary. Certainly, his mistakes are not at the same level as others. He would not drift into noob errors easily, but on average, the quality and impact of what he does is several orders above what most programmers with a fraction of his experience and knowledge could achieve.Another master is Linus Torvalds. He built an operating system. Yes any one can find a YouTube video today on how to use an open source building block to make an operating system. It will be a very basic replica of what the video shows and when the video has finished playing, that is probably as far as that exercise will go. Linus built a highly complex system on the level of Windows at a time well before videos. He is a master. Mistakes? Sure, but a master in that his command of the C programming language is fluent and powerful in what he can make.Can you master a programming language? You can. You just have to decide if you are going to master it at an academic level in the form of knowing every legalistic detail of the languages or are you going to master it at the level of writing code. You don't have to know every part of a language, but enough that know the difference between when you need to use what is in the language's standard library versus when you need to roll your own. Understand different ways to apply the language such as the normal way the language is used, how to bend the language, and what dark corners to avoid. Most of all, know it well enough that there are no syntax or feature barriers to what you see in your mind's eye and what you can produce. That is one step towards mastery, the rest is making progress from solid use of the language to the point where you are unaware that you are even writing code.",

"Answer": "Let\u2019s assume that you\u2019re a native English speaker, and you want to learn Spanish. You learn to count to ten, you learn how to say good morning and thank you. At this point you\u2019re clearly a beginner, you can\u2019t actually use Spanish for anything.After you study it for a year you get better. You can read children\u2019s books in Spanish, and you can make small talk if the other person says exactly what you expect them to say. Then you take a trip to Guatemala, and try to converse with people. It doesn\u2019t work; they talk so fast, they don\u2019t say the words the same way your teacher does, and they don\u2019t speak using exactly the words you expect them to say. You\u2019re lost. However if you stay there long enough, you\u2019ll learn. You\u2019ll be able to order food, ask for directions, buy bus tickets, and everything you need to do to live your day to day life. You are now much better with Spanish. You\u2019re functional with it.Then you go to a party. Someone flirts with you. Most of it goes over your head because they are using the nuances of the language to convey things, and you don\u2019t understand nuances. In English there is a huge difference between saying \u201cyour dress looks great\u201d and \u201cyou make that dress look great.\u201d There are things like that in Spanish too, but you haven\u2019t mastered them yet. If you stay there long enough you will. I think at this point you can say you\u2019ve mastered Spanish. Not that you don\u2019t have more to learn, but you\u2019re comfortable enough with it that your knowledge of the language isn\u2019t getting in the way of what you want to say.That said, I think you may not be asking the right question. I\u2019ve been speaking English for over 40 years. I\u2019d like to think I have mastered it. I don\u2019t know everything. I do get confused as to when it is appropriate to use who versus whom, and the appropriate places to use a semicolon versus a comma. Still, I can be reasonably eloquent when I want to be, and reasonably precise when I need to be.Despite the fact I\u2019m good with English, I cannot write poetry or novels. Learning more about English will not change the fact that I cannot write poetry or novels. There is a difference between knowing how to talk and having something to say. That is true of spoken languages and it\u2019s true of computer languages as well.People who write compilers need to be masters of a language. It\u2019s not a vital skill for the rest of us. It\u2019s far more important to know how to program than it is to know the subtleties of a particular language. It is not unreasonably to design a program and then sit there with a book and implement it in a language you don\u2019t know. At that point you are not even close to being a master of the language, but you can be a master of programming.",

Software developers are like scientists trying to solve engineering problems.Does a scientist need to master English? I don\u2019t think so. A scientist needs engineering techniques and just the knowledge of English to express his views or write about it.Similarly a software developer needs to master the art of solving issues. He should know how to manage memory, interact with OS, security, performance, design techniques. Once these are mastared a developer can use any language to solve any issues.So don\u2019t fall for languages. It is just a tool to solve your issues.

"Answer": "You can\u2019t. Mastering a language is only possible when you have created the language.I remember something a professor told me before I started my college. Before I met him, I had this general idea that I would finish my studies, I will learn to program and then I will just do my job without needing to learn anything new. My professor emphasized that I will never stop learning because that\u2019s how it is. We are in the era of technology so everything is advancing really fast. Therefore the programming languages are always evolving. For example, if a programmer in 80\u2032s stopped learning and used only the knowledge he had in the 80\u2032s he wouldn\u2019t be able to code properly because the libraries, syntax, framework is mostly changed in all the languages.Of course, you can become really good in a language by creating very cool applications and without needing any help. In that case, you are on the right path.While you can\u2019t master a programming language, you can master programming skills.I believe that programming skills are the most important and to obtain good programming skills, you need to get the right education. Using the right tools programming can become really easy for you and you will feel really comfortable when switching between languages or learning new ones. I would like to say an example of the right education you can benefit a lot. Holberton School. It teaches students how to be a good programmer in all aspects by writing understandable code, working in a friendly and mutual environment, creating applications and systems etc. It is an opportunity that you don\u2019t want to miss.",

You can use programming (MATLAB- simulink) to model a system, determine its poles and zeros, check the Nyquist stabilty criterion or routh-hurwitz criterion for determining the stabilty situation of a system. Moreover, besides stability, we might deal with other control systems in mechatronics like PID controllers, which are way easier to analyze using matlab PID tuning tools and programming, also you might deal with image processing, how can you do it without computers? So, mechatronics- itself is an intersection of three sets: mechanical, electronics and computer, we cannot, not think about using computers to solve mechatronics problems, unless you are using a entirely pure mechanical system (if you want a crude model or use the paper drawings and analysis or unless you are as efficient as Tesla to compute every parts and assembly dimension in your mind) to automate ( I would say such system does not fall under the realm of mechatronics instead robotics or automation)I just covered the use of computers in some areas of electronic/control system design; Also, controllers/processors used are itself a computer. If you move on to the mechanical part; Use of computers is extended from 3D modeling to Analysis (Strucutral, Kinematics, degrees of freedom, and also if fluid/thermal system is involved, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics etc.). Everything is done with programming and softwares.Some of the software/programming tools I have come to know that are used in Mechatronics:PCB design and analysis : Proteus/Online circuit makersMathematical modeling and Simulation : Matlab (Simulink/PID tuner) / AnsysCAD designs : Solidworks, Pro=E, Catia, Inventor, Rhino etc.CAM : Master CAMController/Processor programming: Arduino (C)/ Raspberry Pi(Python I guess)",

Those who will just not do any work would be quite useless, and would probably not put in the time to learn the skills necessary to become a developer anyway.My favorite kind of lazy is the one that gets the work done, but with minimum effort. Those lazy people will generally make good developers, because they don\u2019t jump at the problem head first, but do some planning and design. By the time they get to actually coding their solution, it\u2019s pretty much ready. If they have to also maintain what they developed, they\u2019ll make sure that maintenance will also be fairly effortless.Then there are the procrastinators. They\u2019ll work fine as long as they have a list of quick and relatively easy to do (for them) tasks. It\u2019s good to assign priorities to the tasks, and then invert them\u2026 seemingly unimportant things are exactly what a procrastinator will do instead of a seemingly important one.TLDR: Yes, but only if they are not so lazy that they don\u2019t learn the skills to do the job.",

The idea is picked up and formalized in mathematics as a function.In programming, data mappers convert data from one representation or form into another. Forget the \u201cPattern\u201d bullshit. Object-Relational mapping is specifically about mapping objects, i.e., data in the programming language, to a relational form, i.e., the SQL table entry or entries. (SQL is used on relational databases, hence the name.)Mappers can, and often are, written by hand for small projects. The code tends to be boilerplate however so this activity is often automated. In particular, Object-Relational Mapping software is used to handle the mapping from objects to relational databases (surprise!) for all but small projects.",

"Answer": "This answer basically describes what an aerospace control systems engineer does on his job. Anytime you have to design a control system (PID are really only the simplest types), you almost always develop a mathematical model of the plant and implement it in a simulation.You typically use cataloged data (motor specs, thrust specs, etc) to scale a parametric model of the dynamics of the problem. If you have it, you use lab data (thruster test stands) to derive these basic parameters. For a rocket, you also add a variety of parameters to serve as specifications for subsystems such as :Center of Gravity tolerance, thrust alignments, mechanical alignments, other mass properties etc.With this plant in mind and what you are trying to accomplish control wise(speed, accuracy, stability, disturbance rejection), you construct a controller (you mention PID so I won\u2019t go any farther). That will do what you want. You have to learn this through some (theoretical) trial and error and/or read about various control systems approaches or you find an old pro that knows what they're doing. PID was developed in the 1920; the only thing good is that it is simple.I know I\u2019m making it sound like a bunch of heuristics, but the main issue is you are trying to achieve (at least) 4 distinct performance measures(regulation, tracking,disturbance rejections, stability under parameter variation), with an overdetermined system (more knobs than are nessesary). The structure of the controller is important, but many controllers exhibit similar results.A first step to tuning is to try and adjust your controller gains so that you can control your plant. You do whatever work is nessesary till you understand the tradeoffs(e.g. gain/tracking v.s. stability) and then you wait for an opportunity to test something to reduce the risk. For a SpaceX rocket that probably means tests stations to ensure the rocket motor control performs as expected in some type of restrained tests station.You go back and retune you plant models, and double check all your loops and make sure that no matter what it stays safe. You probably go through some flight safety checks and Failure Modes Effects Analysis (FMEA) and you cross your fingers it all works.No matter what scrap of data you get from the flight test, you analyse it and understand it and all anomalies. You update your models to match the dynamic performance in flight and make any controller adjustments as required.",

Sf Bay software culture values intelligent and well educated hard workers, and there are many Chinese people who meet that description.There are certainly pockets \u2014 teams or companies that have a higher proportion of Chinese engineers \u2014 that is what you would expect to occur in a heterogenous society. But, on the whole, there are nowhere near enough of them for their cultural impact to be considered \u2018dominant\u2019.Now\u2026there is a related question: are they disproportionally represented? That is much more complex discussion. Silicon Valley / SFBay is definitely ground zero for brain drain \u2014 we take (steal?) a lot of the top talent from the rest of the world. And we work hard to accommodate and be inclusive towards people who come from very different cultures. China (and India. and others.) are working very hard to build up educational institutions that train their best and brightest\u2026and are generally not thrilled when we steal almost all of them.As a result, there does exist a situation where American engineers do need to compete in a culture where the best of the best of foreign engineers are encouraged and embraced. This can seem limiting. But the value and money these immigrants are generating is probably creating far more jobs for homegrown engineers than they are consuming.Personally: I\u2019d rather be working with the best of the best of foreign engineers than fighting trade wars with them.",

"Answer": "As others have mentioned, you don't need to be a genius of any kind. All you need is the right kind of experience to learn.If you're given a project and asked to complete it entirely from the scratch, you will automatically learn all there is to do the project.For example, if you're asked to building a game from scratch, you will have to look at it as three main parts. The front end or UI part, the middle or logic part and the back end or data part. You may take longer than usual but you will learn all parts of the development efficiently. And that's all there is to it. Time. No super brain powers.If you wanna learn, do something on the side all on your own. You too will be the jedi that is full stack developer.Cheers.",

"Answer": "Like anything else you generally have the option of going deep or going wide. A \u201cfull stack\u201d developer is going wide. The trick, I've found, is to know enough about things to know when you would want to do something one way as well as being able to search effectively for solutions available on the internet and evaluate them. For instance I'm pretty handy with CSS, but I know only a little bit of SCSS. But I know enough to search for the syntax I would need to solve a problem. Or, as I often phrase it, I know enough to sound like I know more than I do",

When you\u2019ve done pretty much the same thing (say limited users to which pages they can access) 50 times, you aren\u2019t writing a program, you\u2019re stealing one from yourself.

"Answer": "My recommendation is: don't. Let yourself get distracted and learn different JavaScript frameworks.Why do you want to learn full stack development? If your goal is to get a job, specialists are (generally) preferred over generalists. So letting yourself focus on what you're interested in (front end) is a better investment of time than forcing yourself to do a task that is unenjoyable for you (back end).Or maybe your goal is to be able to do a project by yourself. And that's great if it works for you, but I would recommend you talk to some of your peers (either online or in person) and see if someone interested in backend wants to collaborate on the project.If you're still set on forcing yourself to focus, try setting some simple, concrete goals (e.g. \u201cI want to finish this specific tutorial for\u2026\u201d) and time frames for those goals (e.g. \u201cI think this will take three hours, so I'll do it in three chunks of 1 hour each every day when I get home\u201d).

Our first go to place was Angellist & Internshala. Trust me you\u2019ll get ton of application (if you\u2019re looking out for one) esp. during this time. Since we were not expecting applications in such volumes, we earlier planned for a one to one call. But within a day, we realised this is not practical or feasible.The approach that worked, was to come up with a Problem statement. And, don\u2019t underestimate the talent in the country (I did, and happy to be proven wrong). We asked people to come up with an Image recognition model on an in-house dataset (which we thought was a decently tough problem), and asked them to explain the model in detail. Now this is the key, don\u2019t judge them only on the accuracy of the model, but on how good their understanding is, of the model that they choose to go with (Takeaway #1). We gave them the freedom to choose whichever architecture they find best. Alongwith a detailed explanation, we also asked few different questions too, to see if they\u2019re a culture-fit.Even after this, we received more than two dozen responses and quite a many different approaches too.Interviewed all of them.The second thing (and equally important) we looked in them was, how fast were they able to understand a new architecture/algorithm/concept (Takeaway #2). This is to see how strong their intuition is for ML, and believe me if you\u2019ve to see/do ML, intuition is the single most important thing to develop.Hence, we were able to recruit. Hope this helps!",

"Answer": "An admissible heuristic is the one that never over estimates the cost to reach the goal.There are many ways to generate heuristics for a given problem. Relaxing the problem is one of the most used ways.Relaxing the problem simply means dropping some constraints that are imposed on the problem. The sliding tile problem, like any other problem, has rules that will let us move a tile only horizontally or vertically. Moreover, we can only move the tile into a blank space. What if we drop such constraints?We get what we refer to as the relaxed problem.It\u2019s intuitive to reason that the solution to the relaxed problem has cost which is at least as good as the cost of the solution to the original problem. Due to this reason, the solution to the relaxed problem is always an admissible heuristic to the original problem.Now, let us (somewhat) formally state the rule of sliding tile problem.A tile can move from A to B if A is horizontally or vertically adjacent to B and B is blank.We can derive a relaxed problem by dropping the constraint that requires the tile to be adjacent to the blank square. This results in the following.A tile can move from square A to square B if B is blank.Now, the cost of the solution of the derived relaxed problem can be used as a heuristic for the original problem.We can get another relaxed problem by dropping another constraint.A tile can move from square A to square B.There is one important thing to remember, though. The relaxed problem should have a simple way to find the solution; they should not become a search problem of their own. We don\u2019t want the heuristic to be computationally expensive to obtain.",

If you\u2019re interested in the intersection of code, philosophy, and cog sci, then I recommend that you take First Order Logic your freshman year. This class is the prerequisite for Mathematical Logic, which was the most challenging but fun class I ever took at Yale.The cognitive science major is competitive, and you have to apply to get into it. So taking these hard courses your freshman year will give you a leg up on everyone else wishing to place into the major. If you decide not to join the Cog Sci Major, there is also the Math & Philosophy major which is a very intriguing track. I wish I\u2019d done it, but I started too late to get the classes in.You should definitely go to Yale over Princeton for several reasons. But the main reason is that the Philosophy Department is full of very diverse faculty and you will find a wide range of topics to study there. The Philosophy community is small, so you\u2019ll be able to mingle with graduate students in a way that other departments can\u2019t.If I could do Yale all over again, I would just to study Philosophy all over again there. It was so fun and I learned so much every day.

"Answer": "Machine learning requires lots of GOOD driving data made by a good driver in many situations (simulation games can be used too). This is to control the car (basic functions of the car: acceleration, brake, turn, rear, parking, signals recognition). But to drive, a lots of higher level situations should be learnt and humans learn from errors, so to avoid these errors, we learn awareness\u2019s control, I mean what is more important to focus on. we are not robots.You have to learn all bad situations to be good and not surprise when it happens and to know in advance how to react in such situations, this is the best way that you can learn with experience. Not only at driving license school, they just ensure you are not crazy and you have the will to respect basic laws, and you can understand the risks of bad behaviors. So safety machine learning should be used to evaluate bad situations!",

Boiled down it\u2019s just a bunch of computers in a chilled room\u2014not much different from a computer room in 1950; just remote, because the internet makes that simple.As a customer you might not care about anything more than having a remote server you can run in a simple client/server mode.

However, you could just as easily run these on on-premises hardware, to there\u2019s nothing \u201ccloud\u201d specific here.As an implementor, things get much more interesting; you are going to need state of the art virtualisation and distributed systems techniques, and increasingly, custom hardware design.",

"Answer": "You might be interested in the CRAN - Package SuperLearner. It lets you flexibly define which learning methods you wish to to include, then forms a combination of the methods after training to give an estimated prediction.A paper explaining what this package does is http://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/... . \u201cSuper Learner In Prediction.\u201d The following are from the abstract, body, and discussion sections:The super learner is a prediction method designed to find the optimal combination of a collection of prediction algorithms. The super learner algorithm finds the combination of algorithms minimizing the cross-validated risk\u2026 the super learner will asymptotically outperform any of its competitors, even if the set of competitors is allowed to grow polynomial in sample size. This motivated our naming \u201csuper learner\u201d since it provides a system of combining many estimators into an improved estimator.\u2026 Beyond the asymptotic oracle performance of the super learner, our evaluation of the practical performance of the super learner shows that the super learner is also an adaptive and robust estimator selection procedure for small samples. Combining estimators with the weights (i.e. positive and summing up till 1) based on minimizing cross-validated risk appears to control for over-fitting of the final ensemble fit generated by the super learning algorithm, even when using a large collection of candidate estimators. The above examples demonstrate that the super learner framework allows a researcher to try many prediction algorithms, and many a priori guessed models about the true regression model for a given problem, knowing that the final combined super learner fit will either be the best fit or near the best fit. Combining estimators with the convex combination algorithm proposed here appears to also improve on the usual cross-validation selector (i.e. discrete super learner). Selection of a single algorithm based on V-fold cross-validated risk minimization may be unstable with the small sample sizes of the data sets presented here, while the super learner can average a few of the best algorithms in the library to give a more stable estimator compared to the discrete super learner.Thanks to Waleed Kadous - good resource and discussion!",

"Answer": "Yes, this approach is called stacking (see Stacked Generalization). You also need a \u201cmeta learner\u201d that knows which of the algorithms to trust, or how much weight to give to each.It\u2019s less popular than, say, bagging and boosting. It\u2019s a little less practical in some ways, because if you have a single algorithm, you can more easily work out how to reduce its variance (and bias) as an ensemble. This is harder to do in stacking.",

Table 1 lists some common types of programs, the types of input that they accept, and the output that they produce.Table 1\tInput and Output for Various ProgramsProgramming is problem-solvingEssentially, a program tells the computer how to solve a specific problem. Because the world is full of problems, the number and variety of programs that people can write for computers is practically endless.But to tell a computer how to solve one big problem, you usually must tell the computer how to solve a bunch of little problems that make up the bigger problem. If you want to make your own video game, for example, you need to solve some of the following problems:The simpler the problem is that you need to solve, the more easily you can write a program that tells the computer how to work.

"Answer": "A CPU can only interface with anything outside of the CPU itself by executing memory write and read cycles. Within the CPU are a relatively small number of registers that can serve to hold values that are computed during runtime, so the CPU needs a place to put things that are calculated. Also, a CPU fetches, one by one, machine instructions as part of the execution of any program. These instruction opcodes are fetched from memory (although not necessarily from RAM; could be ROM). That is the only way a CPU executes programs. In order for a general purpose computer to perform different kinds of tasks, it must be able to load different programs into the memory that it uses to fetch program code and data from. The only way to allow for this is to use memory that is both readable and writable: RAM.There are additional RAM related activities that make up a computer\u2019s function: cache that optimises the timing of reads from RAM, DMA that lets non-CPU devices access memory, DRAM refresh, memory-mapped IO, etc. Not all memory is RAM, and not even are all memory technology devices capable of supporting CPU execution of programs. Some memory technology devices are more like disk storage, such as SD-Flash, which can only be read by a programmed sequence of operations that access the data by transferring it to or from RAM. On the other hand, there is some flash memory that can support direct execution by the CPU. Generally this is called NOR Flash, and it\u2019s what is often used to hold BIOS and bootloader code. It is random access in that sense, although it still requires special programming steps to write to it in-situ.",

"Answer": "At the most fundamental level data storage is split into three categories.CPU Cache.The cache is a type of low capacity, ultra fast memory that is used for data transactions that cannot wait to be acted upon. It is the fastest type of memory by far yet is very small in capacity.Mass data storage.Hard disk drives, solid state drives & hybrid drives are mediums of mass data storage. They are, in computer terms, slow. They are unable to run applications due to this, but make for good storage mediums when it comes to cached data.Random Access Memory.This used for loading applications due to the the price and speed relative to the two other options. It used to be extremely expensive to make RAM but thanks to a decrease in the price dramatically, capacity has skyrocketed allowing from fast complex programs to be used.",

"Answer": "In short, RAM is a storage medium allowing the processor to quickly store and retrieve data that it needs.It\u2019s effectively the table that you use to hold all your computer and other office equipment, the larger it is, the more documents and other knick knacks such as that desk ornament or that stack of papers you have can be placed on the table.RAM basically provides the processor with a very quick place for it to store data, since it\u2019s own cache is only a few megabytes large, and sending it back to the storage medium would take forever, so to allow for a quick response, RAM is used.Saying that, with the new Optane technology (not really new, but eh) that Intel is now implementing into their processors, RAM now has a slightly more relaxed job, it still does the caching of data, but the Optane memory module will also help it a lot.",

It is so called, because all the programs currently running in the system need to be loaded into the main memory before they start execution (Even the OS, which is loaded during boot time).Also, RAM provides faster access to memory for the CPU as compared to your disk storage, which why it is used to store data to be used during program execution.Apart from RAM, the CPU also uses cache and CPU registers for storing information during the program execution. However, because of their small sizes, caches and registers cannot hold entire programs, in other words they trade speed for size.Order of speed of access to memory:Disk < RAM < Cache < RegistersOrder of Size of memory:Disk > RAM > Cache > Registers",

"Answer": "Let\u2019s have a look at the major features of car and taxi booking mobile app development. These features are quite common across all the taxi and car rental apps and software. Here are the features:\u00b7 Routing, GPS tracking and MAPS\u00b7 Registration\u00b7 Push notifications and Messaging\u00b7 Payment Gateway Integration\u00b7 Ratings\u00b7 Profile CreationAll these factors are inevitable for a taxi booking app but for car rental apps this may change.Routing, GPS tracking and MAPS: It is one of the significant features of the car rental app development services. You need to locate your driver and keep a track on his arrival time. With the help of map drivers can easily locate the users too. So for easy positioning, GPS tracking is mandatory for your car rental or taxi booking application.Registration: Most of the apps are allowing easy registration with the help of easy login through Google+ or Facebook. Your app will retrieve data from these social networking sites so that you don\u2019t have to fill up the form to register with the app.Push notifications and Messaging: Once the cab booking is placed the user has to receive notification with the name and contact number of the driver and the car type with its number. Also, when the user is trying to book the cab, a notification will be sent to the driver which needs approval from his side. This will let your app send a push notification to the user.Payment Gateway Integration: The user has to be allowed to pay for the trip via various payment methods like debit card, credit, card, cash or money wallet. This has to be integrated into your system for easy transactions.Ratings: By rating the driver and the car, it has become easy for the company to monitor the activities of the person. This will help in easily rectifying the problems related to customer satisfaction.Profile Creation: The profile of the driver with his/her contact number and photo will help the user to easily identify the person before they enter the cab.Most of the people are using smartphone and apps for easily managing their day to day activities. So it is wise to develop app for your any business to improve the customer relationship and improve the sales of the company.Car Rental Software and Mobile App for Car Companies, Taxi Operators and Aggregators",

"Answer": "Cloud providers allocate virtual machines at the time of the request to create. Pre-allocating virtual machines is not cost effective. This is why most cloud providers still charge you when the virtual machine is stopped (aka not running): from the stand point of the cloud provider, a stopped virtual machine is allocated and consumes resources that cannot be give to another user.Specifically for Microsoft Azure, there is an entire internal system called \u201cFabric\u201d responsible for tracking how many virtual machines and of what type can be allocated in every single data center. Fabric divides each data center into smaller chunks known as \u201cclusters\u201d. Each cluster can be thought of a bunch of physical computers capable of running virtual machines for users.When a request to create a new virtual machine is received, Fabric finds a suitable cluster and a physical computer on this cluster capable of running the requested virtual machine. Fabric creates the virtual machine and updates it records, remembering that there is one more virtual machine allocated in the cluster.When a virtual machine is deleted, Fabric stops the virtual machine on the physical computer and updates its records to indicate that there is one more virtual machine available in the cluster.",

The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest). It reduces the chance of over fitting. With a single tree, you could be prone to over fitting. It is not universally true that ensemble models are better than single counterparts. It only works when single models suffer of instability. If all the single models are stable already, then a random forest model can be easily replaced with a single model. It is advisable to try both of them on the test set.

Do they have a better understanding of what is needed than you do? Are they suggesting a change that doesn\u2019t make sense to you?My company is a contract software development firm. One of our clients has its own software development staff in house, but gets some outside help from companies like ours. While the people doing the reviews of my code for this company are likely more junior than I am, they have much more intimate knowledge of the needs of the company. They also are involved in the planning and design for the whole system, not just the various libraries, APIs, and applications that I work on. So, their suggestions include things that keep things consistent with those plans and designs.What I do when I\u2019m either unsure of or actually disagree with the suggestion is to talk with the reviewer. We share knowledge and ideas, as well as reasons, for the differences in approaches. I may talk with the project manager (who is also a developer) from our company who is in charge of the work being done on this contract. He might agree with me, with the reviewer, or may even have a different approach altogether. In the end, we try to come to an agreement (even if it is simply that I make the suggested change, with my reservations noted and overruled).So, my suggestion is to start by talking with the reviewer to try to get on the same page. You want to be sure that you understand why they are suggesting something and that they understand why you chose to do it the way you did. If you still don\u2019t agree, then talk to other developers or your boss. The end goal should be to try to find the best solution.",

Ways to make the code clearer, so that six month or six years down the line, anyone who has to modify the code can undertand not only the intent, but what the code is actually doing.Things to remember: The code is not yours, iit's ours (that is, the team's). \u201cClever\u201d is not a complement. \u201cClear\u201d is as much a goal as \u201ccorrect,\u201d and more so than \u201cefficient.\u201dSo when considering a comment (either as giver or receiver), ask yourself, \u201cWill this make the code better, and if so, how?

Less recognized is that it could help with, or take over, choices in things like advertising and fashion design, geological exploration and war.As tools, computers interact with people as well as the people behind them interact with each other. As unique systems with their own thought patterns and decision making skills, they may not do so well. For one thing, some of the people programming them are less than brilliant. For another, there is the possibility of the singularity when those ones that are programmed brilliantly interact with each other.",

In reality, the human brain (and any brain, for that matter) is so complex scientists are still trying to understand how it works. The \u201cNeural\u201d in neural network is simply an analogy to better understand why it works; it isn't an accurate simulation of the actual human brain. The brain doesn't have a back-propagation algorithm because it is fundamentally different from anything that would use such a thing (not to mention several orders of magnitude more complex).",

"Answer": "More precision is necessary to answer you question. If A is such a vector you are referring to, with A=[a1,a2,\u2026,an], does it mean that the a1,a2,\u2026,an are also vectors of same length (lets say m)?If so you can usually assimilate A as a nxm column vector. One classical example is a real matrix A of n rows and m columns which can be equivalently (to some extend) represented as a nxm real column vector.The reason is that there is an isomorphism relating the vector space of the nxm matrices to\u211dmxnRmxn \\mathbb{R}^{mxn}.To measure \u201csimilarity\u201d between such vector, you can use the euclidean distance. however some other distance might be more relevant depending to your problem.",

That front is the sonic boom. The angle at the tip of the V is dependent on how much faster than sound the object is moving. At exactly the speed of sound, the wave front will form a line that moves with the object, at higher speeds it progressively moves \u201cbackward\u201d becoming more pointy.At 0.99999 times the speed of sound there is a huge Doppler effect, but no shock wave at all.",

"Answer": "Sort of.In the early days of powered flight using propeller-based airplanes, aviators found that it wasn\u2019t easy to get close to the speed of sound. There were problems such as propellers stalling, increase in drag, as well as loss of control. These problems appear in the \u201ctransonic regime\u201d, i.e. when the Mach number is close to 1, say between 0.7 and 1.2. It took a lot of engineering effort to build jet engines that could run efficiently in this regime, and to build airplane wings that do not experience drag increase or loss of control.However, the sound barrier isn\u2019t a real barrier that suddenly appears. It refers to a continuum of phenomenon that makes flying difficult. These difficulties would be experienced even as the Mach number goes above 1 (how pronounced they are depends on how well the airplane is designed). The interesting thing is that a lot of these problems go away when the airspeed goes significantly beyond Mach 1, with the airplane being properly supersonic. While earlier aviators were happy to just cross Mach 1 (and establish a record), we now know that if the airplane can go to, say, Mach 1.01, it\u2019s much better to just go even higher until the airplane is in the supersonic regime. Flying at Mach 0.99 would just be a waste of fuel.Bonus reading: Critical Mach number",

"Answer": "The impacts on a century level is a very broad ask. Imagine a cell phone like Nokia 3310 has been relaunched just on nostalgia value within just 2 decades. Things are just happening at a lot of rapidity. But yes, some of the things like cancer research, human health, energy solutions are not yet getting solved at massive scale. The reason why AI is able to take off is because of internet. It is no longer necessary to go to the top institutions to gather knowledge. Everything is organic. Americans are strictly asking whether there is value in spending so much for college whereas the people are not directly hireable at the end of the education process. In India, we are already engineers first and then we take a career choice. So the need for curriculum based education has changed vastly over the last 2 decades. MOOCs are the order of the day and trust me the good ones just absorb what they need from a good online course and make use of it. People are learning at a rapid rate. We are collaborating fast. Other day I had to quickly create a script in a language that I did not have much knowledge but I was able to do it in few minutes. First of all, almost all the basic needs and scripts are already archived and you get whatever cut out flavor you want at the snap of a finger. Secondly, people are scrambling to give you answer on stack overflow and other places because they get points out of it and finally get a lot of respect I believe . Earlier , even 10 years ago I had to search for hours in usenet forums and office common distribution lists for answers. Secondly AI does not need hardware. Anything that needs a lot of hardware or human resources would be a big stumbling block for innovation. For software based innovation it can be done from the basement and the garages. Imagine most of the time when you expect a site or application to not do the same mistake that it did last time or to figure out your name or autocomplete stuff you are actually expecting a human touch and that is now easily getting replicated using AI. Most websites and applications are now learning. So AI will definitely make a lot of progress. The scope for change is huge according to me. Most of the jobs where people are actually just data entry will move to AI. A lot of call center based jobs would go away and some hue and cry from politicians will take place. AI based software will have to pay taxes eventually . Stock pickers AI vs Humans has already beaten the system by order of magnitudes. In medicine a lot of cases like the Ebola victory was a case where man and machine came together. On the other hand the Watson initiative for cancer research is yet to fly. AI in self driving cars would make the need for privately owned cars a thing of the past. Imagine this, the cars that we have are idle for 23 hours a day barring that 1 hour we spend in it during the commute. Some poor souls have it for more. Now if a self driving car that could just reach your doorsteps whenever you need, that would make the need for parking spaces a thing of the past. Not everyone would want to have a car. Many of my friends in Seattle are super happy with zip cars. Many large cities are thinking of doing away with cars. But cities with donut system where the industry and offices will be in the center and the commute from the outside like a ring would still require people to have cars. But with this system, many people would have so much more free time. Accidents would be less. That is a huge impact. Other than world war II and diseases, car accidents are the single biggest factor for human death. With more humans, there might be some changes in the demographics. AI in defense systems will make things actually boring. It would be a interesting path to reach there. But by that time, we might be interplanetary species and planning star wars. My expectation is that will happen in the coming 30 years. AI as part of a neural lace will be interesting as well, with humans being able to use a neural lace. Never forget a face, get all their details at the drop of a hat. These things will make job recruitment much more streamlined. People will also freelance and every one will be working on more than one things in their lifetime. The dating culture would change as well due to this. Businesses would make more informed decisions. Advertisement would actually have to be smarter than they are today. Most of them are somewhat done on market analysis and personal intuition but with AI and data things will be different. Gaming industry will be different and in the web world there will be more deadly competitors and you will not be able to differentiate between a bot and a human anymore. Personal assistants will now have an attitude and character. Weather prediction would get a significant change. Humans will essentially have more time by the end of the century. A new form of socialism where people will actually ask the question \u201c Does every one need to work to get a pay ? \u201c . This socialism will actually be a reality.",

"Answer": "The biggest one I ever did was to try to undo a \u201cmistake\u201d I had made that ended up not being a mistake\u2026We had a bunch of huge tables that were partitioned into dozens of partitions each using HASH Partitioning on an \u201cID\u201d column. So far, so boring\u2026Then, we changed how we generated IDs by introducing an ID generator, and logically embedding a customer number in the lower bytes of the ID, reserving the upper bytes for the \u201csequence number\u201d part of the ID. We did this because we didn\u2019t want to change a vast amount of code in an app that was going from an on-premise solution to as hosted Software as a service solution, and so that multiple customers could have entries in the same tables while still having separate ID sequences.\u2026but we didn\u2019t change our HASH partitioning rules\u2026So, after a good while, I realized that we were effectively partitioning the tables on customer ID because of how the \u201chash function\u201d in MySQL hash partitioning is implemented. It\u2019s a simple Modulus or mod() of the number of partitions on the partition key. For example, if you have 100 partitions, the partition target value is the partition key mod 100.This wasn\u2019t what we had specified in our designs - and as our customers were of rather radically different sizes, it seemed like a bad idea - so I wanted to repartition the tables using the \u201csequence number part\u201d of the ID, on the theory that this would be a more \u201ceven hash function\u201d and would make the partitions approximately the same physical size.I did a few small experiments with inconclusive results in terms of whether this would change performance, but I convinced myself that this was a good idea, and \u201csold\u201d the idea to my boss.So, we took a weekend of downtime and repartitioned by sequence-part instead of customer-id part of the IDs. Several dozen tables, with 9 billion rows total!Afterward, performance dropped about 40% on average.I dove into what was going on and realized that the customer-id partitioning was in fact the most performant way to partition these tables, as partitioning by customer meant that pages (mostly) had rows belonging to the same customer, versus having rows belonging to all customers being on all pages in the \u201cspecified\u201d design.This hozed buffer pool efficiency and massively swamped any performance gain from better hash distribution.So, after falling on my sword in front of everybody, we updated our specs to explicitly partition on the customer ID-part of our \u201cuniversal\u201d IDs.And we did the \u201cundo\u201d repartitioning over another weekend of downtime.Fortunately, in those days our customers didn\u2019t use our product much during weekends, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of issues with them. And the table rebuild got us about 30% performance improvement over the original (because huge tables were Defragmented by the rebuild), so customers were ultimately happy.",

"Answer": "I would say the worst mistakes that can be done on Relational Databases are the ones related to conception (aka: Database Modeling).I probably made many mistakes during my experience on Relational Database. The one that I regret the most is related to my first consulting project - I was an undergraduate studient at the time.I made a table which I named Process (terrible name!) and I also used varchar fields to represent datetime information.Naming things can be really complicated. But try always to not be too general on this task. Process is very generic. Used on many domains of Computer Science field. Another bad example of naming table is Transaction. Again, it's too generic and also it means a really important thing in the domain of Relational Databases! In this case I didn't commit the mistake but I suggested to correct (Yey!).The representation of datetime as varchar was very naive. I just was having trouble to use some of MySQL functions related to datetime. So I thought it would be a good idea to handle this operation with code.Well, I learned that databases are usually faster than code. So, my approach these days is to handle data manipulation and transformation inside database. Then do just the basic stuffs on code side.For my surprise, I discovered that this project was running for 5 year to start reaching problems related to performance. My former boss contact me and asked if I remember any bottleneck. I listed him these ones. Finally I was able to sleep with no regrets! Rsrsrs",

I had a script for truncating and resetting the databases. I also had a application-side transactional identifier in each rows which had been created by a tricky piece of bitmap code that I did not have high confidence in.Anyway, the script for truncating and resetting the databases wasn't done with a TRUNCATE statement, but rather a DELETE WHERE expression based on some bits inside this transactional identifier.Running the script left a lot of old transactional identifiers remaining in the databases. I concluded that the transactional identifier must've been encoded incorrectly. I spend all night running the script on my test databases and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong with the transactional identifier, and couldn't figure it out.Turns out, I had a statement in my own reset / cleanup script that checked to see if it was being ran in the production environment and exited silently if it was.

"Answer": "No, it isn\u2019t inherently wrong to do this. The problem is that, if you spread yourself too thin, you are going to find it harder to acquire enough experience and knowledge about any specific profession. If you can manage that, great, but if you are having trouble because you are going every which way at once, then perhaps you should consider focusing on one or just a few of these as professions, and leave the rest as hobbies.I\u2019m a programmer by profession, with almost 40 years of work experience. I also do some personal projects at home, but I have quite a few other hobbies. I play recreational league hockey, practice a couple of eastern martial arts, am learning 17th-century Venetian rapier, sing, play the guitar and bagpipes, play video games, have just become a member of a new Go club, and read a lot (I have a library of somewhere around 3000 science fiction and fantasy books).

"Answer": "First let's state what such testing is not:You don't run a benchmark task on both machines and simply compare actual run times. By this standard quantum today always loses.We aren't there yet, technically, not by a long shot.Instead you have to look at trends as a problem grows in size, and you have to look at cancelling out the huge advantage classical machines have in the number of bits vs qubits and in clock speed. Finally interesting problems are almost always random in execution time on quantum machines, so you must talk in terms of probability of completion in time t.The above makes comparisons very complicated and are hard to decipher for nonspecialists such as myself.Another complicating factor is that there is much that is unknown about classical computer performance. We might find that quantum algorithm A is faster than classical algorithm B. But is B the best we can ever do ?",

The only problem is that a lot of these problems have to be simulated instead of being solved properly.There's still a lot of debate with how speed is being calculate, so do a lot of research on the speedup claims.Just ask questions about specific clams either here on Quora, or in my PMs. They\u2019re always open.Happy hacking :)",

You want to get as much radiation as possible into the tumor, but as little as possible into the healthy tissue.3D scans take a long time. By the time you finish, the tumor will have moved quite a lot.2D x-rays don't give you enough information. They lose all the structure in the direction of the x-ray. Thanks to some poor design, the machine we use to irradiate tumors and take x-rays at the same time can only irradiate orthogonal to the x-ray, so the direction you lose the information in is the exactly the direction you most need information in!That's where my project comes in.Using a few sample scans of the patient, using machine learning, I can build a model that reconstructs a 3D image of the patient from a single x-ray projection at any angle in real time.",

"Answer": "There are several issues with attempting to answer that question.In order for something to be classified as \u201can NP problem\u201d or not, it needs to be a decision problem with a specific size parameter (usually called \u201cnnn\"), so that we can examine whether instances of that decision problem can be verified in time polynomial in nnn.The term \u201csolving integrals\u201d is not in any obvious way such a thing. Presumably, you mean something like this: a program that receives as input an elementary function described in some formal way, and produces as output an elementary function which is an antiderivative of the input. We can assume that the size parameter nnn is some indication of the length of the input expression.So first of all, that's not a decision problem. Decision problems are only supposed to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on a given input. This can be fixed, by changing the question to be about the class FNP instead of NP. FNP is the analog of NP for function problems, whereas NP applies to decision problems only.Naively, you may argue that verifying an answer to the problem of computing an antiderivative can be done very efficiently, since it merely involves the computation of a derivative. This can certainly be done in polynomial time. So it seems that symbolic integration of elementary functions is indeed in FNP.However, you are then left with the problem of deciding whether two explicit elementary functions are the same: the input, and the computed derivative of the output. That problem is undecidable. It's not a matter of efficiency: there's no algorithm to do this at all. So the problem of computing symbolic integrals has bigger issues than being in FNP or not: it's not algorithmically tractable.In practice, there are good algorithms which handle symbolic integration fairly efficiently, and return the correct answer in most cases. However, it's meaningless to ask whether such algorithms are or aren't in NP or FNP, since they're not algorithms at all: they are semi-algorithms which only successfully work on a subset of their inputs, and that subset isn't recognizable by any algorithm.",

Your computer may reach some unhealthy levels of heat, but that is up to the hardware in your machine. Even with my new desktop, the fans start to act because of the rising heat of the CPU.*Just a warning: Please try and use a computer that has some decent/not extremely old hardware if you are trying to use BOINC often. When I was starting out a few months ago, I tried using my old 2010 Mac to run some projects. Needless to say, it pretty much fried itself after an attempting to leave it on overnight.Happy researching!",

"Answer": "In general, \u201cglitches\u201d arise from electronic noise coupling into a system and they can be difficult to trace and eliminate due to being intermittent.Sometimes it stems from some sort of transient event in the power system which can couple into system circuitry; a fast variance in system power which produces an electromagnetic wave which inductively couples into signal circuitry, or which isn\u2019t filtered out of internal power distribution circuitry due to component failure (or less often, failure in design or filter component specification).Occasionally it\u2019s cosmic; a transient induced in an integrated circuit by propagation of a particle cascade sourced in cosmic radiation. That can result in temporarily flipped bits or in permanent latchup (sometimes \u201ccurable\u201d by cycling power, sometimes not).A relatively common sort is due to mechanically or electro-chemically induced transients in interconnecting components; vibration in worn connectors, oxidation or other contaminants on connector surfaces, etc.It can even literally be \u201cbugs\u201d; in the early history of modern computation, insects getting into systems and causing failures was the source of that slang term.There may also be failures that occur and are briefly observed before system redundancy masks the failure.And those are just a few of the physical substrate routes to \u201cglitches\u201d.",

The problem is that the computer is only doing what it has been instructred to do, and has no information that the instructions it is now executing are unitended.These glitches can take the form of anything - applications can freeze (temporarily or permanently), the wrong output could be displayed, the screen could go blank (again temporarily or permanently), or anyone of a 101 other things.",

"Answer": "One thing that amazes me about Computer Science is the multitude of layers of abstractions and the freedom to operate at any level of our choosing. CS is, at a fundamental level, a science of abstractions.Let us say that there is a real-world problem that we can solve (or, make an attempt at solving) using the knowledge of this field. Here are some of the different \"departments\" where we can get involved -Note how this hierarchy starts off with abstract ideas related to representing a real-world problem using the language of mathematics and ultimately goes down to the specifics of bits and bytes flowing inside wires. Each of these \"levels\" is a well-recognised, and in some cases thriving area of research within CS. What's even better is that the popularity and ubiquity of the field has made it quite easy for either (a) a beginner to jump into any one of these domains or (b) an expert in one domain to gain knowledge of any other domain. This hierarchy of abstractions is the reason why an expert developer of web-based applications can incorporate basic forms of learning systems that can make intelligent predictions using his data. Or, a ML researcher can quickly put together a web front-end to make his research work easier.",

This follows back propagation algorithm. Now that weights are adjusted, your network will give the desired output.

"Answer": "There are 2 good ways, first would be a loop, but then the second way is far more optimal, and since your assignment says to optimize the function, I would say to do it the second way which I will describe.Assign an integer variable for n.Assign a floating point variable to store the value of n(typecast as a float)/2 (I will call it a).Assign another integer variable to store the truncation(floor) of a (I will call it b).If a equals b:the output is the negative of bElsethe output is b+1This of course is just pseudocode, I will leave the actual programming and verification of the code to you.Edit: If the number can be bit-shifted (some variable types cannot), then you could do the following:Assign an integer variable for n.Assign another integer variable to store n bitwise shifted to the right by 1 digit (I will call it a).If (a bitwise shifted to the left by 1 digit) equals nthe output is the negative of aElseThe output is a+1",

"Answer": "To optimize your code, you will want to take advantage of bitwise operators. Declare your function as taking the single integer input argument nnn. It is obvious that the magnitude of the answer is the floor of (n+1)/2(n+1)/2(n+1)/2, which is equivalent to right-shifting n+1n+1n+1 by 1. You need to invert the sign or take the two's complement if nnn is even\u2014in other words, of the bitwise AND of nnn and 1 evaluates to 0 or FALSE.",

"Answer": "You don\u2019t need to store the address of every single bit. And yes in practice single bit locations are rarely used, it\u2019s more like 8 or 32 bits for each address (and you pick out the bits you want).If you want to get the data from the memory, you just provide an address. This address can be an immediate value - the exact (relative) address of the memory byte, or you can calculate it. But most programs will only use a small number of these single values, and yes, each of their address will be in the program code executable.Most of the times though, you have items in memory that are much larger than a byte - tables, text, images - then you just need to remember the start address and how long it is (and its structure if any), then go through it one-by-one. You compute the next address by incrementing the last address until your counted to the end.",

"Answer": "What is happening is that you have a component with 256 bits of storage. You then need to specify an 8 bit number to address any individual bit.Of course, a whole 256 bits of storage isn\u2019t much, you so stack 8 of them side by side, connect all the address wires together, connect all the read and write enable wires together, but leave 8 data wires, and now you have a component that will store 256 bytes of data.To save a byte, you feed an 8 bit address into the system. Because the address wires of all 8 single bit memories are connected, the same address gets fed to all 8 memories at once. Ditto for the write enable signal. Now you have 8 one bit memories all poised to accept 8 different bits of a single byte of data. You put the data on the data lines, strobe a 1 and then a zero on the connected write enable lines, and voila, you have stored 8 bits of data, one bit in each of the 8 memories.What you now have a memory with 256 bytes of data. It is addressed by an 8 bit number - which has, of course, 256 different possible values.Note that you could stack 16 one-bit memory components side by side to give you 256 addresses, each storing one 16 bit value. Put more side by side and we can store as many bits simultaneously as we want. But we\u2019re always limited to 256 addresses.Now, suppose we want 512 memory addresses - that\u2019s one extra address line. We can take two of the 8 bit x 256 address modules we\u2019ve previously built and put them side by side.We can feed the 8 data lines into both modules, plus the bottom 8 bits of the our address lines, but that leaves us with a question of how to use the 9th address line. What we want to happen is that when the 9th line is 0, the first memory module is activated, and when it\u2019s 1, the second memory module is activated.We can do this by slightly modifying the circuit for each module, so in addition to the read and write enable lines, there\u2019s a master \u201cmodule enable\u201d line. We now connect the 9th line to the module enable inputs and use it to select either the first or second module. (Actually, we need to put it through an AND gate for the first module, and connect it directly for the second).If we want to expand the memory even further, we can add more modules, and more address lines. (Each address line we add doubles the amount of memory we can address). To use these address lines, we return to the multiplexer that was mentioned at 7:35. We still feed the bottom 8 address lines into all the modules, but use the multiplexor to convert the higher address lines into the equivalent module enable line. The ensures that only one of our modules is enabled at a time, depending upon the address output from the CPU.",

"Answer": "My main interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is computer vision (CV). Why? Because vision is the most important sense among the 5 senses. Vision is very important for any system, biological or machine, that has to interact with the real world. Vision enables detection/recognition/classification of objects or obstacles within a complex environment.The information from a vision system can be used for planning in robotics and self-driving cars for example. Vision can also be used to estimate motion and structure of the environment and coupled with semantic segmentation the system can provide a very rich representation of the environment enabling the machines to interact with the environments more effectively.I like the new research direction of end-to-end vision system that just learn directly from training data given some objective. Because of their ability to learn end-to-end from training data, these systems are more accurate and reliable than the hand engineered vision systems. That is why I am also developing a novel end-to-end vision system called integrated recognition and inference system (IRIS).The other topics I am interested in are:So the above are interesting sub-problems to work on in AI.Hope this helps.",

"Answer": "As an adjunct to an already excellent answer by Robert Harvey, electromagnetism has also been used as \u201cbinary code\u201d in the use of reel-to-reel tape, audio cassettes, and floppy discs, where the surface of the disc or tape is coated in ferrous oxide (yes, rust) and the polarity of various places on the tape/disc, induced by magnetic current, produces the binary code. Checking the polarity of any given section allows one to read the binary data stored; the only other thing is to create a system of storage/retrieval.It\u2019s important to remember that \u201cbinary\u201d deals with the number two, so if a polarity is in one direction it would be a \u201c1\u201d and in the other direction it would be a \u201c0\u201d. An electromagnet will do the trick.Binary is reproduced in a semiconductor system through voltage levels; generally speaking, a +5 VDC is a \u201c1\u201d and a 0 VDC is a \u201c0\u201d. Of course, there are tolerance levels for the voltage; a \u201c1\u201d could even be as low as around +2.5 VDC and a \u201c0\u201d could be as high as around +1 VDC, depending on the IC and the manufacturer\u2019s specs for it.And, to reiterate Mr. Harvey\u2019s assessment, the power requirements for magnetic coils is much more than that for semiconductors, and not really efficient, which is why things aren\u2019t done that way anymore.",

When you ask about AI you have to question to domains of the machine, this is general intelligence. Currently, machines have almost none, to the point in some categories of this type, insects still have them beat. In that regard these machines aren't capable of much.A Simi generalized approach is machine learning and neural nets, which are all the rage now a days. They can do some pretty cool things like beat people in games that were thought to be 50 years away or even impossible, to driverless cars, to speech to text etc. These algorithms are probably some of the most advanced for our time, and can learn video games, spatial mazes, and more. (look up deepmind)However, they are still very very limited realitive to us. Therefore to answer your question all you have to ask is what was it written to do.

"Answer": "Thank you for the A2AThere is a great deal of work on improving factoring algorithms as it is. Sub-exponential algorithms have already been found, and I expect people will continue to work hard on improving these until there is a proof that they have already achieved the best that can be achieved.In the unlikely event that all NP problems are proven to be in P, then it is very possible that such a proof would contain insights that show how various NP problems can be solved in polynomial time. So I think that both the combination of knowing that a polynomial time algorithm exists and having the insights that come with the proof of P = NP means that we would rapidly come to discover faster ways to factor numbers.What that might mean for factoringWe shouldn\u2019t automatically assume that an polynomial time algorithm is going to be more efficient at factoring than our current algorithms for the values we care about.If we look at the complexity of our best algorithmsO(exp649b(logb)2\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\u221a3)O(exp\u2061649b(log\u2061b)23)O\\left(\\exp\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{9} b (\\log b)^2}\\right)(where b is the number of bits of the number to factor) and compare it to the following, purely hypothetical polynomial time algorithm that requires these sorts of numbers of operations:2500b10100+10101002500b10100+10101002^{500} b^{{10}^{100}} + 10^{{10}^{100}}The latter is polynomial and the former is not. This means that eventually, for sufficiently large b, the second one becomes faster. But I contrived my example so that \u201csufficiently large\u201d b would be absolutely ginormous; and so our current algorithms would be much better for going after numbers that are just thousands of bits long.I don\u2019t think that my example is likely, but I don\u2019t think it is likely that P = NP, either.Factoring isn\u2019t the problemCryptography depends on hard problems that are easy to verify even if we ignore public key cryptography.Consider a cryptographic hash,h=H(m)h=H(m)h=H(m).We want it it be quick to compute H(m)H(m)H(m) but be extremely difficult to compute the inverse of that function:m=H\u22121(h)m=H\u22121(h)m = H^{-1}(h).We can quickly verify (polynomial time) whether any given m is a correct result of that inverse hash operation, but we do not want any fast algorithm to actually compute it. That is, we depend on the inverse hash computation being NP and definitely not in P.[1]This also goes for symmetric encryption as well, but I found it easier to construct the example with a hash.Note[1] The requirements for the one-way functions that are necessary for cryptography are stricter than the definitions used for hardness in complexity theory in that cryptographers need these things to be \u201chard\u201d for most random input, while definitions in computational complexity typically talk about the worst case inputs. So if one-way functions exist, then P != NP, but P != NP does not necessarily imply the existence of one-way functions.",

"Answer": "An efficient algorithm for factoring would not prove P=NP, it would not even prove P=NP intersect coNP.Also coming up with an algorithm for factoring is not easy, factoring can be kinda reduced to period finding (not exactly true, this is still an active area of Crypto research) and we know for certainty that period finding cannot be solved efficiently on a classical computer, even in worst case you need exponential queries.But let's take the pretext of P=NP, it is crazier than it sounds, P=NP means your key length should be the same as your message, and your key should be communicated without any Computational assumption, the best bet today is to invest in Quantum Key Distribution, which allows for key transmutation along large distances without any Computational assumptions.Some guy will undoubtedly say just use an EXPTIME-Complete algorithm instead of something like factoring, but hey! If it is EXPTIME-Complete even verification is not efficient (unless NP=EXP, in which case considering the pretext P=EXP), so some guy will place an order on amazon and send his credit card number but by the time amazon verifies it the sun has exploded.Cryptography would be focused on efficient key distribution, because once you have a key it's easy to use the age old one time pad to exchange information.Also there would be more research into stuff like multipartite entanglement which might allow for more efficient key exchange between multiple parties\u2026..But this is a dystopia, if you don't understand what I mean read My 116-page survey article on P vs. NP: better late than never",

"Answer": "If P = NP, then public key encryption (who\u2019s security relies on prime factorization being hard) would be broken.If P is found to equal NP, it will most likely come from somebody finding an easy solution to an NP-complete problem. If you find an easy solution to an NP problem, then you prove P = NP.Any problem in NP can be reduced (in polynomial time) to an NP-complete problem, so if we were to find an easy solution to an NP-complete problem we would have an easy solution to any problem in NP.This would include prime factorization. So you would be able to reduce prime factorization to the NP-complete problem you found an easy solution to, and have an easy solution to prime factorization.So encryption relying on prime factorization being hard would break.",

"Answer": "Are you just starting learning big data and machine learning? How does your programming knowledge?If you really just starting learning or developing big data and machine learning, I would recommend python. Why? Because it has a really easy-to-use ML library, such as scikit-learn: machine learning in Python or TensorFlow. It is, in my opinion, so easy to use and makes you faster in exploring your data.Another plus point for python is you can even use them in your production code. A spam detection service developed by my team is using python and it is going well.On other side, if you are already familiar with your data and machine learning algorithm you want to use, and there are already another Java/Scala code you want to integrate with your ML, go with Scala. I have never developed an ML with Scala, so I cannot recommend any ML library, though.Have a nice day!",

Even for people who go into elite careers like investment banking and management consulting, the most complicated mathematics you\u2019ll be doing is Excel and financial statement analysis, all of which you don\u2019t learn in STEM fields. Granted, companies like Goldman Sachs and Bain do hire many STEM majors, but that\u2019s only for the fact that these students exhibit strong basic/fundamental/universal skills like critical thinking and logical reasoning.Many firms, however, don\u2019t have the resources to spend getting new hires up to speed on business know-how, especially when those hires are likely to leave for better jobs in a couple years (case in point: investment bankers typically stay for only 2 years). Therefore, they probably prefer to hire students who already have a decent understanding of business, how it operates, and what to do. Moreover, many business majors will take on extracurricular and summer activities that gives them relevant experience. For many jobs, such as accounting, you really don\u2019t need some superstar technical genius. You just need a hard, detailed worker, which doesn\u2019t require a STEM degree.",

"Answer": "This is not only possible, but is already happening in some implementations of neural networks, especially deep learning networks. The key to such meta-automation is a technique called feature engineering. Feature engineering in neural networks allows combinations of inputs from the training data to these neural networks to be considered as an input, or a feature, thereby lowering the loss function of the neural network significantly. The result of this is that we\u2019re able to improve the efficiency of neural networks by automatically including features that we wouldn\u2019t include.Deep learning techniques (which are neural networks with hundreds of hidden layers) can accomplish this more easily than standard machine learning techniques such as decision tree algorithms or least-squares regression. In the process, deep learning networks are able to learn very complex relationships from the input data, and are excellent for pattern recognition tasks. Deep learning networks are, as a result, used in image processing, region detection in images, captioning, audio processing, and such related techniques.",

"Answer": "This is actually a bit harder to answer than you might think. If you want to be technical about it, the dominant branches of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning. Most of the time that means classification/regression and clustering, respectively. These are the things that data scientists use much of the time that are purely ML.To answer your question more in the spirit of what you probably mean, I would say that much of ML work right now falls under neural nets and natural language processing (NLP). Note that these are really intersections of ML with other fields. Neural nets are more or less what falls under the intersection of ML with computer vision (among several other things, but NNs are dominant right now). ML has a long and interesting history with NLP, but it would be a mistake to refer to NLP as a branch of ML, as it has far more in common with linguistics.There\u2019s more, of course. Ranking is an old intersection of ML with information retrieval, for example, and Google spends much of its resources making that work well and fast.Caveat: these are really gross simplifications and reflect a lot of my opinion as well as experience.",

They both have relatively easy paths to functional understanding, but in my experience, the Dunning-Kruger effect with respect to these technologies is extraordinarily high; that is, a person FEELS that they have mastery in these pretty early on in their experience, but the reality is that they have much left to learn. I have worked with hundreds of developers, all of whom claim to know HTML and CSS, however they frequently claim what I see as a trivial change is \u201cmagic\u201d. Conversely, while I \u201cknow\u201d and have written in JS/ECMAScript, Java, Coldfusion, etc, I am relatively out of my element with respect to those who specialize in those domains.Whatever the case, \u201ccool\u201d doesn\u2019t hold much water for me as a measurement. I have focused almost exclusively on HTML and CSS, architecting the UIs for eCommerce applications that handle large numbers of users daily (>1M). In my experience working with developers from around the world, most of whom describe themselves as front-end developers, only a tiny fraction (~1%) of those have truly grasped HTML and CSS. Again, as there is a relatively low point of entry to HTML and CSS, it\u2019s pretty easy to output elements to the page and style them to look a certain way, but there\u2019s a heck of a lot of nuance that one wouldn\u2019t know existed much less have an opinion on the pros/cons of various resolution approaches without having detailed knowledge and experience within the medium.My first experience with computers was in the 70\u2019s, my first coding (really scripting) was in the 80\u2019s, first exploration into web, coding professionally and implementing APIs in the 90\u2019s, and I\u2019ve been focused almost exclusively on HTML and CSS for the past 10 years; I\u2019ve trained developers on design/component patterns, accessibility, content strategies, RWD/AWD/RESS, Mobile, touch devices/inputs, etc. All of this and I still learn something new and valuable every.single.day. EVERY day. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be able to specialize in this area of the web and work to help others understand it\u2019s nuances (and more importantly, design frameworks that help designers, product owners, and developers to not have to worry at all about HTML + CSS in the first place, allowing each to specialize in their areas of expertise)\u2026I think that is very cool.",

In fact we cannot efficiently simulate even randomized computers on classical computers, there is a reason Casinos spend insane amounts of money on true random number generators which rely on Quantum Mechanics! (We didn't prove P=BPP, we proved that there exist polynomially indistinguishable random number generators)Today in CS class we were designing Algorithms and my algorithm took almost a hundred times the time my friends took, but hey it is still O(n)!You can simulate a Quantum Computer if you had polynomial space and exponential space (you don't need exponential space, there's a trick, ie bounded error (Bernstein, Vazirani)) and in fact if you wanted a better Bound you could even do it in AWPP (Fortnow, Rogers). But not effiently, ie in P.Quantum Computers can be seen as Turing machines that have internal states that are exponentially big positive semidefinite trace one matrices and the state transitions are also all positive semidefinite. And this is insanely more powerful when compared to the model where you have binary strings and also much less powerful than if you could use any matrix.Why we have positive semidefinite trace one matrices specifically is a question for Statistical Mechanics.

By default, an AI has no preferences, no opinions, no goals other than those we have set.People think that intelligence must necessarily imply more. A classic example is Asimov who thought that robots without explicit guidelines (the laws) would \u201cnaturally\u201d tend towards arrogance and contempt for less intelligent humans (in \u201cLittle Lost Robot\u201d, 1947). But that\u2019s just conflation. Who could blame Asimov for it, considering he had been drafted into Lewis Terman\u2019s IQ club - certainly there\u2019s a lot of arrogance and contempt in that very human kind of intelligence. But to anyone who\u2019s played around with a real, useful machine learning system, it should be obvious that this connection is spurious.Maybe we can look the other way while we set these goals and pretend that our Pinocchios are more independent than they really are - but don\u2019t count on any holy interventions making it true.",

So the next number would be 246. The transitivity gets screwed over if there are odd numbers of elements.",

"Answer": "In Unity3D, you will not create a true, university level, learning AI. Not because it is impossible, but because it is unnecessary and performs very poorly (extreme AI cases might take days to make decisions as they filter/sort through information). AI too powerful will also raise the hardware requirements on your game dramatically.When it comes to video games, the only thing that is important is the illusion of intelligence (in terms of AI). A weak AI agent can ruin the game, simply by appearing unrealistic. A strong AI agent can ruin the game as well (ever been shot through walls in some games?).The trick is to neatly lay out everything that is necessary for your AI to perform well. Do they traverse the level? You will want to start learning your graph logic so you can implement path finding algorithms (Dijkstra\u2019s/A* for example). An AI that maneuvers appropriately is a great first step towards creating that \u201crealism\u201d.After that, you might consider the AI\u2019s interactions with the player. A tree diagram is fantastic for branching dialogue paths. The realism here comes from how well your writers perform (or how well you write). Through appropriate responses, you can give you agents the illusion of intelligence. I recommend utilizing XML or JSON to achieve this.Lastly, but probably most importantly, I feel that everyone attempting to implement an artificial intelligence into a video game would be well served by learning about, and how to implement, finite state machines.Every time you need to add a new layer of realism to your agents, you simply just design a new state for them to be in. Do you AI soldiers mindlessly run into gunfire headfirst? Easy fix, create a state for them in which under certain circumstances they will flank instead of approaching (I.E. More realistic path finding).I sincerely hope this helps to steer your course in development to a realistic, obtainable, and profitable goal.",

"Answer": "Something difficult about adapting to technology that isn\u2019t already here is predicting what the technology in question will be like. This is difficult because breakthroughs, which enable more advanced technology, are difficult to predict themselves. What jobs AI will take over and when depends heavily on its capabilities.However, some jobs do indeed appear more likely to be automated than others in the coming decades; for instance, while truck drivers and telemarketers\u2019 jobs are in peril, and while lawyers and employees of financial firms may not be in much less danger, it currently appears somewhat unlikely that AI will replace the jobs of other professions relatively soon. For instance, while AI is ever-improving in the medical field, it will likely not replace all doctors and surgeons within the next several decades.But that\u2019s a temporary fix to a profound issue, and it won\u2019t work forever. Maybe it won\u2019t be until the end of the century that most jobs are taken by AI, or maybe there will always be some jobs for humans, but that doesn\u2019t mean there doesn\u2019t need to be a solution.One idea, though a poor one, is using government to punish or hinder automation. This would put countries that implemented it at a severe disadvantage, and would, again, be a temporary fix.Another proposed idea is that of a Universal Basic Income, a government payout to everyone that covers basic living expenses (food, water, power, clothing, etc.). While it can be criticized as wealth redistributionism, which it is, it may be necessary to prevent wealth from accumulating exclusively in the hands of those who own the factories.Ultimately, in my opinion, to deal with automation, we must take a fundamentally different view of work, and perhaps of our motives for progress. Work doesn\u2019t need to be the part of one\u2019s life that gives meaning. Similarly, profit doesn\u2019t need to be our motive for progress.",

"Answer": "In terms of the problem it is designed to solve, it recently beat a super computer we have today! (See [1701.04579] Quantum Annealing amid Local Ruggedness and Global Frustration)The Dwave Computer is not a Quantum Computer in the conventional sense, it is a specific purpose device, that uses a specific quantum phenomenon to solve a certain problem and nothing else.The reason Dwave makes so much money, and everyone is interested in buying their \u2018computer\u2019, is that that problem has become increasingly important over time.The new Dwave (they changed a lot in the last few years from basically propaganda to now a stable startup) is a great startup focusing on a spinoff technology of Quantum Computing.I will not bash them ever again, in fact now I want to work at Dwave, they are doing some awesome science!See also, Scott Aaronson\u2019s recent blog post on Dwave: Insert D-Wave Post Here",

"Answer": "It depends on what you\u2019re trying to solve. For a few very specific problems which have been specifically designed to be manipulated by quantum algorithms, the D-Wave computer has been shown to out-perform classical computers.However, for the vast majority of real and practical problems, super computers are superior to the D-Wave one. This is because D-Wave\u2019s computer isn\u2019t a \u2018full\u2019 universal quantum computer. It works with quantum annealing to solve optimisation problems, and so would be unable to run well-known quantum algorithms such as Shor\u2019s.D-Wave\u2019s most powerful computer has 2000 qubits, and if it were a full universal quantum computer, it would have sufficient power to break RSA encryption, rendering it obsolete. This technology is still far away. However, D-Wave\u2019s computers are still very useful, and owner\u2019s such as Google and Lockheed-Martin are using theirs to solve real-world problems.",

"Answer": "For 1200 dollar range, I would suggest without a doubt a build like this:GeForce GTX 1070 8GB Mini ITX OC, 100R ATX Mid TowerKeep in the mind the R5 cpu\u2019s aren\u2019t out until April 11th, and you could cut the cost of a monitor in half by going for a cheaper one, or instead switching to an RX 480 or GTX 1060 for the graphic card. I strongly lean toward the Ryzen 1600($220 or 1600x($260) cpu in this budget range as you are getting 6 cores and 12 threads, comparable to an intel i7 6800K but a lot cheaper. Before Ryzen, I would have recommended maybe an intel 7600k or 7700K, and maybe for gaming they will get a couple more FPS right now, but in a couple years the Ryzen CPU will outgrow them in all aspects.",

"Answer": "1200 is a good budget. I believe that $900\u20131300 is in the price/performance sweet spot, and 1200 gives you a lot of leeway in picking your parts.The key to getting good price/performance is looking for sales. Unfortunately, that means that the \u201cbuying the parts\u201d stage could take a long time, such as waiting for black Friday or a good daily deal on newegg. So onwards.CPUAt least. 6th gen i5. U could go for 7th gen i5 or 6th gen i7 if you really want. I don't recommend going to i7.Otherwise, you could get a high end (lol) amd CPU and over clock it, but I'm not a fan.GPUAMD Rx 480 whichever gives best price per performance.You could go nvidia, but I find that they are more expensive. I would reccomend 1080/1070/980/970/880(do those exist?), depending on what fits in your budget.If you don't plan on playing AAA titles, then you could use integrated GPU and place the money towards something else.RAM8\u201316 GB of low clock speed ddr4 RAM. I remember Linus Tech Tips did a video on RAM clock speed, and found that it doesn't really matter.MOBOI don't really know much about motherboards. Buy a mid price motherboard with a few PCIe slots, a few sata slots, and good IO. Look for both 10/100/1000 Ethernet and 802.11ac/b/g/n WiFi.CaseDon't spend $500 on a case. Buy something humble. Second hand works great. Reusing cases also works.OSWindowsStorageYou can trade off between amount and speed by buying HDD or SSD. I'd recommend a hard drive now and an SSD when you can afford it (if they don't fit in the budget), or vice versa if you prefer. 2TB HDD or 120gb SSD would be good.PeripheralsReuse from your old build or buy them on sale.PC partpicker buildThis is a simple preliminary build. I didn't look into parts much, mainly just picking one of the first 3 on the list. This leaves you arount $150 to buy better parts, but with sales you will find more options. Reddit has a sub dedicated to good parts deals, but I forget its name.Not included: monitor, peripherals.Core i5-7600K 3.8GHz Quad-Core, Radeon RX 480 8GB GAMING X, TESSERACT SW ATX Mid TowerAgain, this is just a simple price estimate build, I put literally 10 minutes and no research in.",

"Answer": "Well, it\u2019s all about the amount of new stuff coming along.In law, for example, new laws are made all the time - and judicial decisions about existing laws come along even faster. Presumably a lawyer does have to read the relevant journals that present the more important changes if they are to stay relevant.Doctors have a similar problem keeping up with new drugs, newly revealed drug interactions and side-effects, new surgical procedures and so forth.It\u2019s hard to imagine a marketeer having quite so much to keep up with, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if one of them pops up here and says that it\u2019s hard for them too.So, I don\u2019t think there are many careers where the knowledge you have as you come out of college to remain, ossified forever, immune to all change.Now - for me the problem in your question is the assertion that programmers have to gain knowledge in \u201coff work hours\u201d. I\u2019ve never found that to be the case. Most employers are willing to let you spend a little time each day catching up with what\u2019s new. Generally, when you hear that a new algorithm has been discovered or that a new programming language has appeared, you simply note that it exists, consider what advantages it has and whether it\u2019s relevant to what you\u2019re doing right now\u2026and mentally file it away for the future.Then, when you are starting some new piece of work, you may recall reading about a solution of some kind - and now it\u2019s up to you to go to your management and say \u201cI heard about this great new \u2018thing\u2019 that\u2019ll make this project much easier - is it OK for me to spend a few days reading up on it?\u201d\u2026generally the answer will be \u201cYes\u201d. If your intuition is correct and this is the very thing you need - you go back to management and point out the enormous benefits and carve out enough time for you to learn about it.So in general, you shouldn\u2019t need to spend a lot of your own time doing that.The big \u201cgotcha\u201d comes when you want to change fields. If your job is a web designer and you know PHP and JavaScript - but you want to get into video game programming - then you\u2019ll probably have to learn C++ and HLSL on your own time\u2026but changing career tacks that rapidly isn\u2019t a common thing - so while you\u2019ll probably be spending some of your own time learning, it won\u2019t be a continuous thing.I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019d be surprised if lawyers, doctors and people like that have it any easier than programmers.",

There are a lot of wonderful ways to make a very intelligent chatbot that can learn new things. But, it\u2019s very easy to create a chatbot that appears to be smart, when all it really does is analyze the frequency of words in a sentence and replies with a statistically appropriate pre-written message.The sad thing is that these primitive chatbots usually appear much smarter, humanlike, and coherent than anything approaching \u2018true ai\u2019 in a chatbot. The closer you work towards \u2018true ai\u2019, the less and less all of your time (and money) pays off.So why bother? Curiousity? Yeah, right.You have to pitch it as an industrially useful tool.

The focus will shift from simple infrastructure solutions to developing cloud strategies.Adaptive Security Architecture: The intelligent digital mesh and related digital technology platforms and applications are creating complex world for security. The technology companies will be focusing more on the security applications due to a complex world of interconnected platforms and applications. Organizations will need security-aware application design, application self-protection, user and entity behavior analytics, API protection, and specific tools and techniques to address IoT and intelligent app related vulnerabilities. With the addition of the IoT frontier, slowly, we are observing newer security implications. Security providers will have to factor new remediation tools and processes.Data Privacy: Data privacy deals with the ability of an organization or individual to determine what data in a computer system can be shared with third parties.Analytics: Big data analytics examines large amounts of data to discover hidden configurations, correlations and other insights. With today\u2019s technology, it\u2019s possible to analyze data and get answers from it almost immediately.Virtual Reality: Virtual reality or virtual realities (VR) is immersive multimedia or computer-simulated reality. It replicates an environment that simulates a physical presence in places in the real world or an imagined world, allowing the user to interact with that world. They are new wave of computing devices that will transform the way individuals interact with one another and with software systems.Digital Technology Platforms: They act as a basic building block for a digital business. Gartner has specified 5 major focal points that enable new capabilities and model businesses. These points are Information system platform \u2014 Supports the back office, operations such as ERP, core systems, and associated middleware and development capabilities to deliver solutions. Customer experience platform \u2014 contains the main customer-facing elements, such as customer and citizen portals, multichannel commerce, and customer apps. Analytics and intelligence platform \u2014 Contains information management and analytical capabilities. Data management programs and analytical applications fuel data-driven decision making, and algorithms automate discovery and action. IoT platform \u2014 Connects physical assets for monitoring, optimization, control and monetization. Capabilities include connectivity, analytics, and integration with core and operational technology systems. Business ecosystem platform \u2014 Supports the creation of, and connection to, external ecosystems, marketplaces and communities. API management, control and security are the main elements.Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers: Blockchain and distributed-ledger concepts are becoming popular as the industry thinks that they hold the power to transform the operating models. Apart from the financial industry, they have future applications in identity verifications, title registry, supply chain, healthcare, music distribution etc. Bitcoin is the only proven blockchain. Its architecture not only supports bitcoin transactions, but also enables authoritative recording of events, immutable snippets of data and simple programmable scripts. They lack scalability, complete transparency, have limitations concerning consumption of resources, Operational risk from unintended centralization of resources (mining) etc. They also bring adoption challenges like lack of standards, robust platforms, scalable distributed consensus systems, interoperability mechanisms. While they have immense potential, Gartner says that they are still in their early alpha or beta testing stage.Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Machine Learning: Applied AI and machine learning are composed of many technologies and techniques (such as deep learning, neural networks and natural-language processing [NLP]). These technologies, which are different from traditional algorithms and programs, make the machines intelligent. Gartner predicts that the applied AI advanced machine learning will inspire applications like robots, autonomous vehicles, consumer electronics, virtual personal assistants, and smart advisors. The smart machines are context & event driven. They will be able to deal with complexities, understand, learn, predict, adapt and act anonymously.",

"Answer": "I would suggest you to start with learning about the coding basics,it will include defining variables, literals, functions and basic iterations. You can do this much in good depth in about 100\u2013150 hours. Once you are comfortable with this start to learn about some micro-controllers, AVR or arduino are good to start with, personally I find AVR better to start with as it let's you to think in terms of hardware circuits more easily. But at later stages adruino is much easy to work with and have a better community.You can learn about arduino from its website and discussion forums. Simultaneously search some basic electronics projects from the instructables website ( I will provide the link below) and electronicsforu website. Once you find some project interesting, then get its components and start building by following the instructions. I would recommend you to use bread boards instead of pre-built circuits at the initial stage, once you have developed good understanding of the circuit working then you can use various shields to make more complex circuits.You will learn a lot while working on projects. There are usually multiple ways to complete one operation, so do some research about them and try to understand them as well. At last make the best use of the online electronics community, you will get numerous tutorial available on the web, nowadays websites like collaborizm are providing a good platform to discuss and collaborate on projects, so do check it out.And remember that you will always learn the best by doing, so give more attention to the practical work.Hope this will help.Reference:",

If you just want to learn programming then you don`t need to learn all these.World around you is analog. Get some idea about analog electronics. Voltage, current, Kirchhoff's law, resistor, capacitor, transistor, transformer, induction motor and relays.Introduction To Analog ElectronicsFree Analog Circuits BooksBasic Electronics Tutorials and Revision for Beginners and BeyondWe need sensors, antenna, motors, relay and ADC to convert from analog signal to digital and vice versa. Computers are digital. Learn basics of digital electronics - logic gates and Boolean algebra. Analog circuits are used to create digital IC.https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/74642...Digital ElectronicsDigital Electronics Basics - Chapter 1: Logic Gates & Boolean AlgebraMicroprocessor is a complicated digital circuit. To program a computer you need to understand it has input and output ports, address bus, data bus etc. Learn 8085 architecture. 8085 is an 8 bit processor, your laptop probably has 64 bit. Learn about RAM, serial and parallel data transfer.8085 ArchitectureMicro-controllers are programmable microprocessors. Now a days Arduino is popular. Raspberry pi is mini PC capable of running Linux. Robot is built using micro-controller, relays, servo motor, digital image processing, infra red and ultra sonic sensor. There is artificial intelligence software and real time operating system used. Software programming is a lot more different. Developers dont know much about electronics. They access api exposed by the operating system.Electronics is a good hobby but we need lot of theoretical knowledge as well. You should pick what topic to study.",

"Answer": "I am also a Mechanical Engineering graduate. I think the Arduino is a good place to begin, you can get an Arduino Uno from ebay (China sellers) for around $5.00. Get some sensors like a few sonar modules for a few more dollars, a bunch of 9g servos for around $2.00 each, and 4 or so plastic wheel/gearmotors sets ($6.00 each). With that, and some foam core and hot melt glue, you should be able to build a robot that can avoid obstacles. You can add a couple of HC-05 Bluetooth modules to control the robot from another Arduino and a joystick, or just one HC-05 and a smartphone app. See DIY How To Make Instructions, Adafruit Industries, Unique & fun DIY electronics and kits, and SparkFun Electronics.Radio is a fun hobby, take the arrl.org technician test and get the technician license.

"Answer": "Oh, for sure.We can build mechanical analogs of any software process - so if we ever figure out how to make a true AI - then it could certainly be built as a purely mechanical contraption.However, it would be gigantic beyond reason!If we decided that an AI had to be built as a neural network (which is easy enough to do in software) - and if we found that our AI machine needed as many neurons as a human (about 100 billion) then we can maybe estimate how big it would be.If the mechanical equivalent of a neuron was a box of gears and levers 1cm on a side then the machine would need a billion cc\u2019s of neurons - which would be a cube about 10 meters on a side\u2026that\u2019s not TOO bad.But the human brain has 100 TRILLION interconnections between those neurons\u2026and that\u2019s what explodes the size of this thing. In the human brain, they are mostly between 1mm and 1cm long (although some reach down the spinal column and are a meter long!)I suppose the smallest mechanical interconnection that could snake through that box would be a \u201cbowden cable\u201d (like the brake cable on a bicycle) - and maybe we could make them be 1mm in diameter if we were really clever. 100 trillion 1mm cables - each with an average length of maybe 1000 times that of the human analog\u2026so we\u2019re going to have 100 trillion cables, each a meter long and a millimeter across. I\u2019d assume that you\u2019d need maybe ten times that amount of space to allow for the routing of the cables and all of the neurons.That\u2019s a volume of about 100 meters x 100 meters x 100 meters!In truth, it would be much worse than that - you\u2019d need to get power and lubrication to all of those parts - and there would need to be access to them from outside to replace them when they\u2019d fail.Then there is a matter of speed. A typical neuron may need to fire about 1,000 times a second\u2026so those mechanical neurons will be spinning very fast and those cables will be sliding back and forth much faster than such things are normally expected to move. So either our mechanical brain will be hundreds of times slower than a real brain - or we\u2019re going to need to remove a lot of heat from friction!This machine would be the size of a large mountain\u2026at least.In a real brain, the neurons are continually re-wiring themselves - making new connections all the time. In neural network software, we instead alter the \u2018weights\u2019 of predetermined connection patterns. It would be insanely difficult to build a mechanical device that rewired itself - so it\u2019s more likely it would use neural weighting, like a software neural network.Bottom line - yeah, it\u2019s possible in principle - but not in practice.Now - final point: The human brain does seem to be something like a computer - in that we can memorize things FAR faster than the brain can possibly rewire itself\u2026this means that (at least in part) we are \u201csoftware\u201d - but we also know that if the brain is briefly \u201cswitched off\u201d - it can reboot itself without serious problems\u2026which suggests that there is long term memory that DOES result from neural rewiring. Perhaps the reason people don\u2019t remember what happened to them after a serious car accident is because the \u201csoftware\u201d lost it\u2019s working short-term memory before there was time to rewire the hardware to make the memory permanent.To extract the \u201csoftware\u201d from a human brain would likely require us to determine the location of every one of those 100 trillion connections. The result would be a giant table of 100 trillion pairs of numbers - each stating which of the 100 billion neurons was the source, and which the destination of that connection. Naively (because there is doubtless more to it than that), we\u2019d need about 6 bytes per connection - so 600 Terabytes of storage\u2026100 hard drives or so.",

For the most part it doesn\u2019t seem like it has.By mechanical if you mean something that does not utilize electrical systems (loosely speaking a system that depends on electrical potential difference) the answer would be possible but not feasible from an engineering point of view. But I don\u2019t think that was the intent of your question. I think what you mean is something that works because of its hardware features only and not governed by something like \u201cprogramming code\u201d that is stored somewhere - for example something that has information encoded in a proper language.",

That\u2019s not necessarily understanding how they work, but what the reviews are on the most popular brands.Now, I\u2019m in CS, and I am also a PC gamer, but the two don\u2019t overlap that much. The exception is if I feel like modding or hacking a game. Then I can draw upon both skillsets.Even game devs don\u2019t necessarily know anything about computer science. You can pump out a game SUPER easily without knowing much of anything about how computers work or algorithms. Of course, graphics and AI are big in gaming, not not necessary for every individual dev to know.Gaming is really it\u2019s own niche thing. It doesn\u2019t make you a computer genius just because you play videogames. However, you do find a lot of CS students who are gamers. You also find that games are a topic in CS, and topics in CS are sometimes applicable to games. But it\u2019s a lot less related than one would think.",

"Answer": "Yes. There\u2019s a whole branch of Computer Science, called Formal Methods, which aims to do it.The basic idea is quite simple to explain.Take a system, any system. It could be an industrial plant, an airplane or an undersea pipeline lay vessel. It could also be a piece of softare, a CPU or a communication network.A model of the system is written by humans in a formal language, whose syntax is precise an unanbiguous. The model fully describes the system with all its properties.Using the same language, it is then possible to write properties that describe \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d behaviours of the system.Once all of this has been done, it is run through a special type of software, called a model checker. Using complex algorithms and logic properties, the model checker verifies that all \u201cgood\u201d conditions are satisfied and all \u201cbad\u201d conditions never happen. In all possible cases.This is exactly \u201csolving critical problems\u201d, except it is done before they happen. It is done before the system is even built.This is what Intel and other CPU manufacturers currently do. Instead of building a new processor (which requires the creation a poduction line) and testing it, they first write a model of it and have one of their big supercomputers verify its goodness using model checking techniques.",

"Answer": "Yes! All the time! Every single day!Computerized simulations are used in the design of all sorts of things.For example - I was making a set of three childrens building blocks - the kind with a letter of the alphabet on each face. I wanted to find the best set of letters to use so that children could spell out the largest possible number of three letter words using just three blocks. My blocks have computers in them - they know which way up they are and how they are placed relative to each other - and can send correctly spelled words to a remote computer someplace!But what letters to put on the cubes to allow the maximum possible number of words to be spelled? It\u2019s not an easy problem.I spent an hour to write software to do that. I fed the software a list of all of the three letter words I could find from a bunch of different sources - and ended up with a list of 307 moderately common words. Then I had the software figure out the best set of letters to let you spell out the maximum possible number of words. I used an \u201cevolutionary algorithm\u201d that randomises the faces of all the cubes - finds out how many it can spell then randomly changes one letter and recounts. If the new count is better, it keeps the new letter and if it\u2019s the same or worse, it undoes the change and tries a different random choice.I found that no matter what starting point I used, it always converged on 125 different words that could be spelled\u2026so this is very likely to be as good as you can get.End result the letters on the three cubes have to be: NPTHBA + AEIOUY + GDTSRW, and they let you spell 125 different words: AGE, AGO, AIR, AND, ANT, ARE, ART, ASH, ATE, BAD, BAG, BAR, BAT, BED, BEG, BET, BID, BIG, BIT, BOG, BUD, BUG, BUS, BUT, DAB, DAY, DEN, DIN, DON, DOT, DUB, EAR, EAT, END, ERA, GAP, GAY, GET, GNU, GOT, GUN, GUT, HAD, HAG, HAS, HAT, HER, HEW, HID, HIS, HIT, HOG, HOT, HOW, HUG, HUT, NAG, NET, NEW, NOD, NOG, NOT, NOW, NUT, OAT, OWN, PAD, PAT, PAW, PEG, PER, PET, PEW, PIG, PIT, POD, POT, PUG, RAN, RAP, RAT, RAY, RIB, RIP, ROB, ROT, RUB, RUN, RUT, SAP, SAT, SAY, SEA, SET, SIN, SIP, SIT, SOB, SON, SUB, SUN, TAB, TAG, TAP, TAR, TEA, TEN, THE, TIN, TIP, TIT, TON, TOP, TOW, TUB, TUG, TUT, TWO, URN, WEB, WET, WIN, WIP, WIT, WONYeah - hardly an earth-shattering problem - but I couldn\u2019t have done it any other way. The computer had to figure out that using (for example) two G\u2019s so you could spell \u201cEGG\u201d, \u201cGAG\u201d and \u201cGIG\u201d wasn\u2019t as good as adding a second A to give you more flexibility, even though I had no words with two A\u2019s in them in my list. I\u2019d never have figured that out for myself!Software can be used to solve MANY problems - some trivial, like mine - others very important.",

This might have some uncomfortable downsides and moral issues, we are playing with the human biology after all, but the upside is much more important in my opinion, and that is that with an excess number of players in the field we are guaranteed to fix the majority of diseases or ailments plaguing the human society.Second, and possibly the one big impact that AI will have, is availability of medicinal technology (but I really do not know a single word to describe this. Please ask me to clarify if I am not clear going forward). By this I mean AI will make it possible to have medtech (if you will) available to consumers at reasonable prices making it a common household item. Think of those medpods we see in the movie Elysium but more realistic. Especially with advances in nanotech, we can just have a machine treat us instead of a doctor, and these machines will be made simple enough for the average person to use. Or, you can choose to have nanobots constantly in your body, offering real-time protection (like an antivirus :]) and having full control through a phone app (or limited control since it is basically run by the AI). So this will likely put a lot of doctors out of jobs since a medical background will not be necessary to handle these machines. Except maybe to build them.Of course, it will first begin with the small things, ie easily treatable ailments like colds etc. But as the AI gets better (read intelligent) then it moves on to more complex stuff like cancer and AIDS. To immortality even (pretty exciting right?).The major drawback obviously is that the first iterations of these AI will be ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) and since they are written (built? created?) by humans they will have some flaws in them. For them to actually complete the task given (eg cure malaria) then it is the dev team that has to account for all possible scenarios and such. For example, if the AI does <action> to one part of the body, will it affect other parts? Of course being human there are some things they might not be able to anticipate. But this becomes irrelevant if the AI becomes an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence). I have an answer that briefly explains these types of AI or you can get a more in-depth explanation from WaitButWhy\u2019s article (also linked in the answer).That is why AI is such an important topic but people almost never talk about it. I haven\u2019t met a single person who is interested in talking about AI, except my twin brother, and its basically just like talking to myself :[.Anyway, hope I gave you food for thought.",

"Answer": "If \u201crelated technologies\u201d includes remote monitoring and instrumentation for observing vital and no so vital signs; artificial intelligence should allow far more follow-up and patient status assessment than is currently possible.Currently, I have been given a remote monitoring unit which can interrogate my pacemaker and relay that information to my cardiologist. Presumably because reviewing these results consumes more professional attention than the practice can afford, this monitoring occurs on the order of every six months.With miniaturization and improved sensors, it would be possible to keep track of all the patients of a practice on a daily basis. Evaluation by AI eliminates the issue of professional\u2019s time spent checking healthy patient\u2019s readouts. Add to such a practice monitoring all sorts of bodily functions and blood levels. The result would be a significant avoidance of sudden medical surprises.To expand the concept, I suspect that feedback after a patient sees their doctor, receives their diagnosis and is given a prescription to fix the problem\u2014there is far less than optimum followup. Unless the patient returns or their well being is in serious doubt, there is little or no checking to determine the accuracy of the diagnosis or the prescribed solution. Do we know how many diagnoses are wrong? How many medical problems resolved themselves, regardless of the treatment? Expanded instrumentation and monitoring coupled with inter-communication between diagnostic servers (AI) would add to the body of knowledge about common illnesses and treatments. (There\u2019s lots of that going around.)Imaging the following phone call: \u201cHello, this is your Medical AI speaking. Your instrumentation suggests you are on the verge of coming down with astromeliatic somensone. I have sent a prescription to you pharmacy. Start it immediately and take a day off from work. I will keep track of how you are coming but by Thursday you should be fine.\u201dTo emphasize the point\u2014AI would permit several orders of magnitude more following and followup of indicators of patient well being.",

"Answer": "Okay, just to contradict most people on here: it is possible to convert between frame rates but you don't gain anything particularly. It is called frame rate conversion and it is how movies get converted from 24fps to 30fps NTSC and 25fps PAL.You can do more than doubling, it is called motion compensated standards conversion and it uses very clever analysis to generate missing frames but it isn't perfect and doesn't add anything.The problem with finding high frame rate (HFR) video is that there aren't many cameras that shoot it and there is no incentive for producers to put it in their workflow unless they are doing slo-mo or special effects.I have seen a BBC R&D demo of proper 140Hz video and frankly it was beautiful. The fluidity of the motion and the temporal resolution was amazing. 25/30fps is the minimum and we have been stuck with it for far too long. Now that we have a totally digital distribution workflow the world needs to move to 150\u2013300fps as soon as possible.Until then you will struggle to find any video and it isn't worth trying to 'up-convert' anything.",

"Answer": "You cannot convert videos to a higher frame rate\u2026Reason being is, a video is recorded with a certain frame rate in mind. If it has a FPS of 30, for example, a 10 second video will have 300 frames contained within it. Speeding the frame rate up to 60 requires either a doubling of frames, which isn\u2019t possible unless you duplicate frames (Which will have literally no effect) or you reduce the overall video time. 300 frames at 60 FPS gives 5 seconds.In effect, all it does is speed up the video.About finding 120 FPS and 144 FPS videos - You can\u2019t, at least not for any mainstream videos, and especially not music videos. Even 60FPS is uncommon outside of gaming/tech media. This is because when you upload a video, you\u2019re uploading a series of images or frames. This means that at 60 FPS, the video uploaded takes twice the bandwidth of a 30 FPS video of the same length, content and resolution. At 120 FPS the video is four times bigger, taking four times longer to upload and consuming four times the bandwidth.For a small video, this doesn\u2019t matter. However for a normal music video of ~4:30 minutes, downloading (Post site compression) the 30 FPS 480p version is already ~25MB, which is 100MB at 120 FPS. That is not considering that if you\u2019re looking for this kind of quality you also want a minimum of 1080p or preferably 1440p if you can support it. At those resolutions, each frame becomes pretty expensive and wanting to quadruple the data is a feat in its self.",

Scientists are trying to answer the question of how to make a computer system think is through observing how a child learn.When a child comes to earth , he is a blank slate with no prior information.\u00a0 Then he observes others around him, try to figure out the cause and effect of each action that he observe. Next stage for him is to imitate what he learned in known scenario. Finally comes the unknown scenario where the child has to apply what ever he learn to answer question previously unknown to him. If he makes a mistake, he is corrected by his elder and he start learning again. So it is a never ending process of learning and applying the knowledge,An AI behaves similarly.\u00a0 An AI is a mathematical model that start with a blank slate and uses training data to make a sense out of the data given to the model. It \u201cobserves\u201d the behavior of the data and try to find correlation. There are many models to define correlation , decision tree is used to find grouping of closely related object ,\u00a0 clustering is used to find the affinity of one object to another. Once the model is trained to certain level\u00a0 it is applied to the real world unknown scenario to determine relation previously unseen in training model. if the is a mistake in finding a relation ,\u00a0 i.e. the confidence of the learning model is low,\u00a0 it is trained again.For example if we take the example of NELL (Carnegie Mellon University)\u00a0 .It learns the sentence \u201cJohn_Hana is a politician\u201d and \u201cThomas_Reynolds is a politician\u201d then it can effectively bracket John_Hana and Thomas_Reynolds in same category. Now if it finds,\u00a0 \u201cThomas_Reynolds is a member of congress\u201d and \u201cAlma_Adams is a member of congress\u201d ,\u00a0 it is easy for NELL to decide \u201cAlma_Adams is a politician\u201d .So It leaning and applying the learning in unknown environment is the key to artificial intelligence.",

"Answer": "I would say it has been a very, very long time since I\u2019ve ever felt \u201cI have no idea of what I\u2019m doing\u201d. Maybe when I was first starting out, before I understood the concept of functional decomposition of problems.I think about programming somewhat differently.I see it in terms of interacting systems, layering, and abstraction at layer boundaries.Layer boundaries are religious to me: if you define an API layer, you can call down to it, but it can never call up to something above it.I think recursive locks are evil, and any time you take a lock recursively, your program should crash itself, and you should find out where your layering violation is happening: because buddy, you have one.This lets you look at everything at the appropriate level of abstraction, and it lets you drill down very easily.I also think about problems a little differently.I view problems of being a single instance of all possible problems in a potential problem space. So if I\u2019m building something new, I try very hard to make sure that anything I do, even if it concerns a very small part of the problem space for that specific problem, does not preclude coming back later and extending it to encompass the entire space.Sometimes, if you take this approach, this makes you look like you are wasting a lot of time over-architecting some small component. Something that should take three days may take a week instead.But there\u2019s a dirty little secret that no one tells you when you are starting out: if a product, or platform, or library, etc., is successful: there\u2019s always a later in which you will have to come back to map a little more of the problem space.And at that point, if you spent 7 days instead of 3 on the work: the change is trivial.And if you spent 3 days instead of 7: you most likely have to rewrite. Or introduce a back-dependency that later results in a bug\u2026 because if you don\u2019t rewrite to do what you should have done in the first place, well\u2026There\u2019s always a later.I find that this concept is very difficult to explain to someone who doesn\u2019t think in Markov Chains, which is to say: anyone who is not somewhere on the autism spectrum.Back when I was working at Apple in the Core OS Kernel Team, if there was a bug in the Mac OS X kernel that was causing you a problem in user space, I could probably tell you just from the bug and the call you were making to trigger it, within one to two files where that bug was.And if it was in a file I had worked on: I could tell you within about 100 lines of code.And if it was my code, I could probably get you within about 6 lines.If you start to see things as systems of components, and each component talks to and reacts to other components, and the relationships between the components are rather strictly defined \u2014 negotiated API contracts, no callbacks/upcalls, nothing that makes a mess of the call graph and therefore the component relationships\u2026You could easily do the same thing.I think it takes a little autism, and a lot of experience. If you are cut out to be a programmer: you\u2019ll get there one day too.",

"Answer": "Responding to A2A.I\u2019d say yes, in general you know what you\u2019re doing. In the sense that at any given time you know what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and what your current goal is. So, you work towards that goal - by either implementing feature, fixing bugs, doing code maintenance, etc.The situation where you\u2019re left without a goal and have no idea what to do next is (IMO) incredibly uncommon. Of course moments of confusion and moments when you\u2019re unsure how to proceed happens, but in general, there\u2019s some sort of goal you\u2019re supposed to be moving toward.As for \u201cachieving that level\u201d (it isn\u2019t anything special?), well, I suppose you could break your problem into small task, and try to work at one task at a time. This way you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re trying to do.",

"Answer": "In theory, immutability makes a program slower. It\u2019s faster to modify existing objects in memory than allocating new memory.In practice, the performance loss of using immutable objects is negligible at worst and negative at best. Immutable objects make development easier and more clear-cut, which is good in itself, but also leads to more efficient programs. With all the defensive copying generally going on in OOP, the amount of garbage often exceeds what you would have in a functional program.I have been working on a machine learning library where the only mutable structures are feature matrices, as I think this is a good tradeoff.",

"Answer": "I can\u2019t speak for machine learning, but I can for Scala, because I\u2019m familiar with the language. Scala indeed favors immutable objects, but there are mutable versions of all Scala collections ( for example I like scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer which is a very flexible way of handling a mutable array, you can add and remove elements in the middle of the array without any hassle ).On the other hand - irrespective of mutability - Scala is indeed slow. The reason is that in Scala there are no primitive types as in Java. In Scala everything is an object ( the parent of all objects is \u2018Any\u201d ):Since everything, even primitive types have to be packaged as an object this results in an overhead over Java.Apart from speed however Scala is in every respect superior to Java. It is a very expressive language and it is easy to create scalable high level objects in it. This may be the reason why it is more suited for machine learning.Memory usage test code:Result:",

"Answer": "It depends. Different people find different things interesting.Are you a guy who is interested in solving problems or learning new things? Are you intellectually curious about the different technologies that exist? Do computers fascinate you?For me, computer science is the most interesting science on the planet. But biology or zoology probably wouldn\u2019t be ranked that high up (I love neuroscience though). There are people who love interacting with others and are probably great salesmen. There are those who love literature.So the real question should be do I find computer science boring? And if you had to ask that question, you probably do.",

"Answer": "Thanks for the A2A. This question has been on my to-do list for a while and that pushed me to actually go through it.The consensus problem is often discussed in the context of distributed systems, but the most frequently mentioned algorithms that are used to solve it are Paxos[1][2], and the more sophisticated versions of it such as Raft.[3]However, one of the leaderless, or masterless, algorithms that you can use is what is also called total order broadcast[4][5][6]. It may sound counterintuitive, but consensus is the same as delivering same messages in the same order on every node in your system. So, instead of the approach, where nodes have different roles, you have nodes with equal responsibilities that have a goal of delivering messages in the same order.Total order broadcast guarantees you the following properties:So, basically you have an algorithm that ensures that all of your correct nodes will see messages in the same order, which effectively means they have consensus on each message delivery. Additionally, you may want your broadcast to be causal and reliable, but that is something that is a little out of scope of this answer. Moreover, there are some complexities you have, when you allow nodes to freely join your group. Let\u2019s see how we can get a simple total order broadcast working for a single open group, but without a leader, which in this context is also called sequencer.Here, I would describe what is called destinations agreement algorithm, where your nodes need to agree on three things:The following excerpt is from the page 389 from the Total Order Broadcast and Multicast Algorithms: Taxonomy and Survey[7]:For each message, the destination nodes reach an agreement on a unique (yet not consecutive) sequence number.\u2026To broadcast a message m, a sender sends m to all destinations. Upon receiving m, a destination assigns it a local timestamp and sends this timestamp to all destinations. Once a destination process has received a local timestamp for m from all destinations, a unique global timestamp sn(m) is assigned to m, calculated as the maximum of all local timestamps. Messages are delivered in the order of their global timestamp, that is, a message m can only be delivered once it has been assigned its global timestamp sn(m), and no other undelivered message m can possibly receive a timestamp sn(m ) smaller or equal to sn(m). \u2026 the identifier of the message sender is used to break ties between messages with the same global timestamp.Additionally, there are many other algorithms in that paper that I would encourage you to read through if you are interested in leaderless consensus.",

You are probably ready to replicate most of the algorithms in that book in Python.But the important part is knowing when to use them, and how. Sometimes you only need part of an algorithm, or a data structure made of nodes consisting of some weird data structure you came up with in your head and can't really describe with words.The algorithms in that book are very theoretical and very broad. Which doesn't make them any less important. My point is, learn them and replicate them first, you may be a long way off from using them in practice.Of course it depends on the algorithm and the objective though.",

Harder stuff - i.e., domain-specific algorithms - involves researching the domain-specific literature, and is where one is more likely to develop one\u2019s own algorithms while building a system to solve a specific problem.Personally, I consider CLRS and Knuth to be like the CRC handbook for math. You learn the math class, and go to the book when you need to find a specific formula - your classwork is what helps you figure out what you\u2019re looking for, and helps you understand it once you\u2019ve found it. CLRS & Knuth fill a similar role when you\u2019re looking for, say, a sorting algorithm - but these days, you\u2019re more likely to just go looking for whatever sort function or library is standard for the language you\u2019re coding in - the reference books help you understand it.",

Some of the best researchers think we are 5\u201310 years away from solving problems like multimodal image understanding (beyond image recognition), internal language consistency (with some common sense beyond correct syntax), one shot learning and transfer learning (for speed and adaptation - i.e to other drivers foolishness).

It\u2019s an area of Machine Learning where deep learning techniques are typically SotA, but even then it varies from dataset to dataset. for IMDB RNNs (I believe) currently hold SotA, but for tasks like summarization there isn\u2019t even enough agreement on which metrics to use to measure success to have a definitive SotA, though DPP is pretty good.Recurrent Neural Networks and Word Embeddings are two of the most popular tools being used in SotA research nowadays, but it would be very misleading to actually say they are \u201cstate of the art in natural language processing\u201d.The general motion of the field has been away from linguistics and toward models with little to no pre-built knowledge, but NLP is a massive field and there are plenty of sub-problems where linguistic models are still reigning champs.",

The continuum hypothesis is that there are no intervening numbers between these two sets. We do not know whether the continuum hypothesis is true, and it is generally accepted nowadays that it is not even knowable by present methods.Thus, we can\u2019t really say why it cannot exist because we don\u2019t know whether it can or cannot exist.",

"Answer": "Qualifying the meaning of Existence must be consistent with the meaning of scientific.In my opinion, the notion of continuity necessitates the invention of the irrational numbers, which can only be proven with the argument of absurdity (it is not rational therefore it exists). The attempt to reproduce what is a visually perceived effect of continuity was invented to explain the pictures we draw. 0 has to be added to the irrationals to fill in one of the gaps opened up by continuity. This is typically done by defining it as a special case of integer. Continuity is not a not measurable observable and repeatable process which a scientist can rationally assert (it can not be repeatedly measured scientifically).In my opinion, continuity is in conflict with the notion of atomic. It can exist as a belief for a mathematician but not as fact. As such, believing it is delusion due to its irrationality of any attempt to prove its rationally. Rational arguments can only be shown for Gaussian Integers and their ratios. The notion of simultaneous also places the existence of ratios in suspect.This is just another of the irrational methods which have surfaced in extending the number system.",

"Answer": "The problem? They can't be generally applied to produce solutions for the majority of computing problems. The majority are those that involve the representation of concepts, real and imagined, and the relationships between them. To these, an \u201calgorithm\u201d doesn't apply.Neither an algorithm nor heuristic will help you here, other than potentially as part of a system that models the problem domain under consideration. For example, an algorithm or heuristic will not help you model the operation of an elevator. However, there is a standard algorithm used for an elevators movement between requested floors.Likewise a parcel delivery system may in places use an algorithm to determine a most efficient route. However, that algorithm while important, is only a small part of a complete parcel delivery system.Outside of these \u201crepresentational\u201d type systems, the utility of algorithms (and heuristics) themselves, are more important with problems represented by programs that are regarded as a mathematical function, or set of equations, describing a relation or relations between input and output. Problems more traditionally seen in computer and data science.Note: for the purposes of this answer, an algorithm is not defined as simply being any procedure.",

"Answer": "The answer is quite positive. And the answer is not limited only to accountants.Actually, as a more efficient and accurate tool, artificial intelligence has been improving the life of human greatly, in the past decades. And the worry never stops since people are losing their original, here and there in many fields.As a matter of fact, when supermarket/companies/factories first occurred, many private shops closed and vanished. Instead, the cities grew bigger, offering much more jobs in much less spaces. And the life has been greatly improved since then.I do believe that we should hold the view for a phenomenon, especially a new one, in a wider and longer scope. AI is improving the efficiency, (creating more vacancies for people actually, by enlarging the market), setting free the people that used to work in flocks in a huge workshops. Then people are more free to heavy labors and have more time to travel and enjoy life.We are not living in the heaven, and the competition and ruling out is always there. People can feel the impact of AI, because it\u2019s very powerful. Other new and old less-powerful things are actually making people lose their jobs, without awareness. We are living in a system, where any change may cause extra changes. Hence it\u2019s not wise to deny and repel a new thing just because it makes some difference.On the other hand, the less positions of accountants, doesn\u2019t mean that the accountant work is also gone. The accountant professional will be there for a long time, but in a different form.The point is that as a person who works and lives, we need to be prepared to learning new things.

You can try few simple steps that will boost the shit out of your system.Since you're dragging that machine from ancient ages I presume that you know quite a bit about computers but still adamant to using the same old machine maybe you have some sentimental values for it.Anyways here's my suggestion:1.) Type %temp% in the search space under windows 10(since you expressed you are going to install windows 10) and without giving second thought press ctrl+a followed by a brutal ctrl+del and then enter. Don't give it a second thought as it's 100% safe.2.) Under search option type \u201csystem configuration \u201d go to Boot tab and click at advanced options button check \u201cnumber of processors\u201d and select 2 if you have dual core point being do a lil research about your processor and select the maximum number from the drop down list. Then check maximum memory box and type 1024 then press ok and reboot. You will notice a good speed boost already.3.) ctrl+Shift+esc this will bring forward the task manager then under start-up tab disable all one by one. This will reduce boot time.4.) Back at system configuration under \u201cservices\u201d tab click at \u201c\"hide all Microsoft services\u201d then uncheck all the remaining boxes save and restart.5.) Diasble all the options that will run processes in the background such as several update services from everyth including host system updates, various browsers updates, various media player updates etc.6.)

"Answer": "I\u2019m not going to give you the answer, but I will explain some concepts.You may be confused by how C does array access. You cannot copy an array by trying to do an assignment. Say you have two integer arrays, a and b. You cannot copy a into b by doing:In fact, if you do this, the compiler will complain that you\u2019re trying to assign a value to an entity that cannot be assigned to. Typically you would use a standard library function to do the copy, but since you say you need to use pointers for the copy, we\u2019ll skip discussing the library function.C\u2019s forte is operating on the computer\u2019s memory directly. It\u2019s what the language was designed to do, aside from accessing system functions. To C, an array is a block of the computer\u2019s memory, and it always accesses it using pointer arithmetic, even if you simply say something like b = a[5];.The way you will need to copy the contents of one array into another is to copy each element from one into the other.Think about the relationship between array indexing (as in b[i] = a[i];) and what you\u2019re trying to do. All an array index in C does is offset from the base address of the array (where the array starts in memory), doing some pointer arithmetic, and then dereferences the result to either retrieve a value, or store it, depending on if the array reference is being used in the expression as an l-value, or an r-value. Generally speaking (there are exceptions, but for this discussion, let\u2019s keep it simple), an l-value will be on the left side of an equals sign, and an r-value will be on the right. An l-value expects to store a value, and an r-value expects to retrieve its value for the assignment.It is also possible to carry out arithmetic operations on pointers, and you can use this to access elements inside an array. So, you can do:This carries out the same actions as doing:Notice in the first example, I used *p as an r-value. It\u2019s also possible to use a pointer dereference as an l-value.Say I have two pointers, pointing to two arrays. I can use them to assign elements from one to the other:This does the same thing as:Another aspect you\u2019ll need to know is how to use loop structures to repeatedly copy values from one array to the other. I would suggest a for-loop would be the most appropriate one to use for what you want to do. You can see how to use for loops at for loop in C.",

"Answer": "The problem is that the compiler doesn\u2019t know the unit size to copy.You can say (which doesn\u2019t work) a = b; where both a and b are arrays\u2026 But the problem is that the compiler can\u2019t tell whether you mean to copy the first element or the entire thing. For arrays the symbols a and b are constant addresses.The only way to do a copy of an array is to put the array into a structure.Now the compiler knows the unit size. You have two symbols a, and b - where both are structures. To assign one to the other means the entire structure, and the arrays just happen to be contained in that structure.",

"Answer": "When the host is shutdown typically the host OS sends a request for all processes to complete. After a reasonable time (which is usually an unreasonably small time) the host kills the processes that are still alive. The VMs are processes running on the host. So they get a request to shutdown, but if they don\u2019t, and since VMs usually take a while to close down, the VM processes will get killed. Basically the VM will experience something similar to an abrupt power off situation and will likely go into recovery mode on startup.In VirtualBox that I am familiar with, you can configure the VMs to go into \u201csave state\u201d as opposed to full power down, where the host sends a close signal. As this operation is much faster, it is likely the VM will be saved (processes terminates successfully) before the host kills the process.Author VirtualBox at warp speed, Book",

"Answer": "Hi,Pretty much, although patent lawyers can, on the surface, seem like a cumbersome and unnecessary addition to the already difficult path to securing a patent, I assure they are truly invaluable for their abilities in regards to their better understanding of the industry, their exposure to patent literature, and last but certainly not least, their professional connections. However, they are expensive despite being invaluable, and there are some things you can potentially do to minimize the financial impact. What I would recommend is doing some research on your own so that your lawyers' billable hours are kept to a minimum. The way to do this is to search through the Google patents and the USPTO databases, so you can at least get the ball rolling before paying top-dollar for a lawyer who will start there anyway. It may also help to check out some of the free resources on Wysebridge as well. By providing access to a wealth of resources, Wysebridge turns even the layman into an educated expert, to an extent anyway.Regardless, I hope I could be of some help. Good luck and G-d speed!Best,",

I can't even estimate how many times I've had clients come in and want to save money by not having a search done, because they just *know* that no one else has anything like it, because they've done a search last year...but patents are often not published until 18 months after they are filed, and sometimes not even then.\u00a0 (Note that the desire to save money often results in clients going to attorneys that advertise that they do the patents fast, and don't do a search at all.

"Answer": "Basically, for a very logical reason: for decades, the size of any electronic gadget / part has been getting smaller, very much so for computer chips and motherboards, i.e. you can pack components with even better efficacy / performance into some smaller space.One result of technology getting smaller and smaller in size is portable devices - take your cell phone: it\u2019s way more powerful than an 8-bit home computer of the 1980s/1990s or a 80286/80386 PC. You use your cell phone for many purposes but probably least for actually calling s.o. Notebooks, ultra books, cell phones, tablets etc. are the almost obligatory result of that development.Furthermore, there are new (storage) technologies available that don\u2019t demand \u201cfat\u201d clients anymore - cloud computing has led to \u201cthin clients\u201d in many companies. You don\u2019t need fully-operating stand-alone PCs anymore, just connect a tiny machine, e.g. a thin client or a Jack PC to your network, and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t even have to worry about local installations, updates etc. Even in many home networks there are (virtual) servers for storing data or streaming music/films etc.From an administrative point of view, I can assure you that central administration is very comfortable - you can distribute software quickly and reliably!Oh yes, one last practical advantage of small size: new technologies have resulted in less cables as well - I really appreciate that! Remember when a huge desktop or tower PC was sitting somewehere around your desk, and all peripheral devices were connected via cables? There was a lot more dust and cobwebs around as well\u2026",

Because people think computer science as only application based subject and they do not understand it has a vast amount of theory in it. Also, Computer Engineering is a subset of Computer Science which they do not tend to realize.Second reason is our country does not emphasize on the research part and focus on its basic applications and not also advanced applications and impact of applications.

You may be able to follow some code on tutorials for machine learning and deep learning, but you will likely not understand why it works and you will have trouble building anything on your own. Trying to learn machine learning and deep learning without any relevant math background is a lot like trying to build your own website without web development experience, Sure you might be able to get some templates and adapt most of the content on your own, but you will never truly be able to make your own unique website.Unfortunately, when it comes to truly understanding machine learning and deep learning, there are no real shortcuts. You have to make sure you understand the math. I would recommend that you spend some time building a foundation on those subjects before you try going into machine learning. After all, no one ever tries to build a house without a foundation.",

At the very least a) look at vectors and matrices before you open a ML book b) look at the statistics basics.Most of the machine learning intellectual activity consist in transforming various input, data, pictures, sound, documents, etc into a collection of values so they can be computed, leveraging maths and stats theorems. Computations are implemented in algorithms. If you don\u2019t understand the reasoning, you won\u2019t understand the algorithms. And you won\u2019t be able to learn them and use them.Check the \u201cAlgebra refresher\u201d on Andrew Ng Coursera MOOC, that will give you an idea of the scope.

As they are tight knit on this project , it does make sense that they use a secure mode of communication which is accessible yet secure.Also there are speculations that there may be rogue A.I to perform hacks autonomously which allows hackers to breach into servers or data centers with undisputed ease. But there is really no actual proof regarding this.If you do want to find out yourself, You can use the TOR Browser and a combo of a VPN and a secure computer firewall.

"Answer": "As has been pointed out, the brain would soon compensate for the higher serotonin levels (or whichever component associated with feelings of contentment and happiness it would affect), and you\u2019d rapidly approach a scenario where the theoretical machine would have to stimulate the brain by an ever increasing amount.If this sounds somewhat familiar, it is because it\u2019s theorized (no conclusive evidence so far, as far as I\u2019m aware), that it\u2019s roughly the equivalent process that leads to various forms of chemical addictions - alcoholism, drug-abuse, medicin-abuse, etc.Today you might be happy after 5 beers, but drink 5 every day, and soon you\u2019ll need 10, then 20, then a bottle of vodka, then two bottles of vodka, and so on, until you reach a point where you can no longer function as a result of your quest for artrificially induced happiness - chasing the proverbial dragon.But if we assume the theoretical machine could accomplish this, without any detriment to the human \u2018subject\u2019, then I\u2019m still not entirely sure it would be for the best anyway - at least going by the indicators we have from the real-world examples mentioned above.Not so much because I believe happiness needs some other-worldly theatre-goer to give substance to the foundation of that happiness, nor that the feeling of happiness could not be synthesized by purely neurochemical means (after all, everything we are and feel is the physical and chemical processes of the brain, regardless of intent, unless we subscribe to Cartesian Dualism or its kin) but because, from a post-humanist view, such a naive utopia would soon crumble, as all motivation would arguably be lost.With no benefit to accomplishing anything - remember, by definition you are happy as can be, and thus wouldn\u2019t want anything to change - there\u2019d be no reason for any individual to pursue anything beyond that simple machine-driven happiness - the film \u201cCubic\u201d or \u201cEquilibrium\u201d already proffers this outlook on such a scenario, simply with a theoretical drug rather than machine - as does numerous other pieces of science fiction.Thus, for such a society to function, we\u2019d have to assume some working-class would maintain and produce these theoretical machines, or the machines that produce and maintain the theoretical machine (ad nauseam), and thus that a certain level of humanity would be cut off from it; sacrificed in order to allow the \u201cupper levels\u201d of humanity to enjoy their happiness - and it\u2019s obvious where that would lead.Conversely, if we created some artificial work-force capable of this task without posessing a desire to reach that state themselves, there\u2019d invariably be members of the \u201cupper levels\u201d that would want them there anyway, or argue that they deserve to be there, and the same outcome would befall such a society.So, without some very strong caveats, we\u2019d end up with a situation where either:The one objection I can think of, is if the machine affected not the emotion of happiness, but the mood of happiness; the disposition of having a positive outlook on situations and events, but without being entirely immune to having a negative emotional response to them - allowing you to feel content more easily, but still feel the pressure of a looming deadline, or the nervousness before a speech, the anxiety of losing a loved one, and so on, but with less of a chance of being \u201cknocked into a pit of dispair\u201d, so to speak.But then we are arguably already moving the theoretical machine closer to some types of SSRI drugs. :)",

"Answer": "Let me answer the last question first. If it is possible to stimulate the happiness button forever, wouldn\u2019t that be the best thing?No. People are not so much motivated by happiness as satisfaction. People like some happiness from time to time, but as long as they feel relatively confident that they will experience more happiness from time to time in the future, people don\u2019t want to burn out on happiness. They would rather be interested than happy all the time, and they usually want their happiness to arise out of things they are interested in.I suppose it is theoretically possible to find ways to trigger the feeling on happiness, but it can never last forever. The brain learns to compensate for floods of neurotransmitters and any other experience that continues forever and ever. Eventually, the brain would edit out the excess happiness.In any case, happiness is not based on neurotransmitters. It is based on interpretations of experience that only the brain operator can create. Happiness is a form of meaning and the only person who can create meaning for themselves is that person. There is no way to make a person think a thought through chemistry. Even if you knew everything about a brain, you could not make it think a thought. People have to think thoughts willfully. Happiness has to be something the person creates for themselves.Whatever physics or chemistry involved in the creation of thoughts, it is not something that can be operated against the will of a person. There is some random element in thought that I don\u2019t believe could ever be forced on a person from outside. It would feel like someone is thinking your brain, and that would create fear, not happiness.Happiness depends on a person feeling like themselves. It depends on a sense of will and self. Any attempt to force a person to be happy would be self-defeating. It would give a person fear. They would wonder who they were. These things are the opposite of happiness. By definition, happiness is something a person can only create for themselves.",

"Answer": "I presume the answer from Tom Cusack is the code you found online. This is an approximation. For functions that don\u2019t have a closed form you can either find a formula based on a series (e.g. Taylor series) summing until the error is sufficiently small, or a ratio of series, or use some iterative process that converges to the true value. Alternatively, you can just use a polynomial approximation or some other finite approximation. There is a mixture of art and science involved in finding such approximations.This code seems to be a ratio of polynomials with degree 20 and 18 with only even powers. This is calculated more efficiently than finding powers of r; it\u2019s a method known as nested multiplication.The only way to understand how it works is to find the research paper on which it is based. Just use the code. (Maybe you can find Fortran, Pascal or C versions in one of the \u2018Numerical Recipes\u2019 books. But they don\u2019t explain how it works\u2014although they might have a reference.)",

"Answer": "I used to look this up in a table.Today I use a convenient computer program, usually a statistical package.But this probably doesn\u2019t really answer your question, which likely is about where the table came from in the first place or what does the computer do to find that number when I want it.The answer is that there is no simple formula.(Recall that e^x is not simple. But also recall the Taylor series expansion.)What people who make tables and modern computers do, usually, is use a polynomial approximation that is known to be accurate for the value I ask for. The specific polynomial differs over the range of values needed. For example, the polynomial used at .01 might be different from the value used at .32.(This is what is done to compute e^x for various values of x. It is what Taylor series are good for. Just compute the Taylor series until you get tired or until the last term is so small that you don\u2019t care about the difference it makes.)It is up to the folks who design computer programs to do the sensible thing when computing these approximations. This is part of numerical analysis. There continues to be research on this topic. Some approximations are quite clever and extremely accurate.In general, this problem has been around since the invention of logarithms. Computing logarithms uses polynomial approximations. These were calculated by hand well before 1800. There were many mistakes in those early tables. (You just try to do that kind of arithmetic all day by hand.) The purpose of Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine was to automate the whole process of calculating and printing polynomials to get more accurate logarithms as well as for other functions such as cos(x), sin(x), etc, as needed, including the error function, e^(x^2).NOTE: Not all software or calculators use the same approximations. Sometimes you can see differences among them.NOTE: I don\u2019t trust Excel to do this, by the way. (Unless it isn\u2019t important and I won\u2019t show it to anyone but that isn\u2019t actual trust.) Use a real statistical package or numerical subroutines.",

"Answer": "A classical computer performs calculations using bits that is 0 representing off and 1 representing on. It uses transistors to process information in the form of sequences of zeros and ones called computer binary language. More transistors more processing ability.A quantum computer uses the laws of quantum mechanics. Just like a classical computer that uses zeros and ones. These states can be achieved in particles due to their internal angular momentum called spin. The two states 0 and 1 can be represented in the spin of the particle. For example : clockwise spin represents 1 and counterclockwise represents 0. The advantage of using a quantum computer is that the particle can be in multiple states simultaneously . This phenomenon is called superposition. Due to this phenomenon a quantum computer can achieve both 0 and 1 states at the same time. Thus in a classical computer information is expressed through single number either 0 or 1 . A quantum computer uses quits which is described as a 0 and 1 at the same time giving us more processing power. For example:In a 2 bit classic computer to analyse 00 01 10 11 , it has to grow through each step to get to a result . In a 2 qubit quantum computer can analyse all the possibilties at the same time. Hence reducing time.",

"Answer": "If you are talking about numerical accuracy, then basically, the issue is one of what one can do with a finite number of bit-patterns trying to represent an infinite number of numbers. For integers, machines these days use 64 bits, so you have 2^64 numbers (about 1 with 20 zeros following). Big, but certainly not infinite. For non-integers, machines use 32 or 64 bit floating point numbers: unfortunately, with real numbers, there\u2019s an infinite number of them between any two different ones, so you can see that there\u2019s going to be problems representing them accurately (since again, one has 2^32 or 2^64 different bit patterns). The standard representation is the IEEE standard 754 (see IEEE 754: Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic): this is quite complicated, and essentially tries to supply the best accuracy that it can within the limits of the number of different patterns available. The wikipedia article IEEE floating point - Wikipedia is quite good at explaining it.",

"Answer": "Interesting problem! Sometimes brute force algorithms are safer if it is feasible.In this case let\u2019s assume the given range is [a, b] is sane and the number is n. We want to find all coprimes of n within [a, b]. Now a straight forward solution would be to iterate over all k, such that a <= k <= b and, determine if k and n are coprime. Two numbers x and y are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. We can calculate GCD using Euclid\u2019s method which has logarithmic time complexity.Another way could be using prime factorization. We first generate prime factorization of all numbers, k in [a, b]. Then given n, we prime factorize it too. Now the problem reduces to finding all numbers k where there is no common prime between k and n. We actually do not need the power of each prime within the prime factorization; we just need the prime numbers. The search is still linear but we can speed it up by using some hash function. This method is more applicable when we have a bunch of n and the range is fixed. As a pre process step we compute prime factorization of all numbers in the given range and store them in a data structure.",

"Answer": "It's usually a bad idea to start from that end of the line, as there are too many possibilities, most of which won't actually be that useful.It's rarely useful to try and build a start-up around a problem space existing companies have existing products and existing customers for. You need a very good reason for them to switch to something untried. It's the \u201cnobody ever got fired for buying (blah)\u201d mindset. You can succeed, but the number of successful start-ups makes me believe the odds of that path working are Not Good.Development cycles are usually exactly that. It takes roughly the same time to progress through one cycle regardless of which cycle in the development process you're talking about.This last rule of thumb is probably a good starting point. If you know that you can afford to spend five years to get to something that's market-ready, then you know that if it'll take everyone else about five years to do the same, they don't get anything like the same mindshare advantage. It's a much more even battleground. That's why Occulus Rift wasn't demolished by Google glasses.So you start with your budget and look to see where you're facing an uphill struggle to gain traction and where the interest and lack of head start by big names will actually pull you along in the enthusiasm.So what specifically would be a good thing?We've seen garage experiments with neural interfaces and serious medical trials, but the intense human effort needed to go beyond the utterly pointless is huge. That's a bit specialized, though. Well, it is until you look at what decoding the signals actually involves.It involves identifying what patterns matter in what cases, and then how a pattern relates input to output. These are two exceedingly generic problems and you see them cropping up in everything from music recognition to facial recognition to game playing to not blowing up the economy.They're ideal for machine learning, since you can linearly separate the domains even if you don't understand why or how.Because they're simple and generic, you can produce simple modules that can perform these basic tasks extremely well. Your R&D phase is then less focussed on what people might want years down the road (because that'll probably be wrong). Instead, it's about making really good bricks that you can stick together very quickly once all the uncertainty has been cleared up. You're not committed to a specific something, but rather any something your Lego-like chunks are good for.Knowing what patterns matter is your interesting problem. For a given complex signal, you can split it into N interesting independent parts and M rather boring parts. (That means you'll still get complicated signals, but none of those N parts depends on anything happening in any of the others and all outputs across all parts are wholly independent.)You then have N independent machine learning problems, so if you're clever enough, they can all be done in parallel, making this very fast.Different types of problem will have different values for N. That's ok. Initially, you're not concerned with that beyond knowing the first module farms out N tasks reliably.Once you get close to market, you need to find a common value for N and build your product with the right number of cores. You know it'll work because you know the cores work and farming works.Those two cores are your IP, not the assembly. Not only do you build various assemblies, you encourage your consumers to if they want. Assemblies are expensive and transient, so you only focus on a few really good ones and get others to buy just your cores to handle the low profit ones.You then develop more cores. These aren't needed for a first pass, but they are needed to build networks of cores of arbitrary complexity.So you can now split, classify, process and merge by networks of machine learning cores, where each core can be programmed inside or outside the network and be either adapting by logic or by interaction.At this point, you'll have sample applications that many people want but also components others can use to build whatever custom project they want.The logic behind this breakdown of parts is time-worn wisdom:",

"Answer": "Amazon. No question.I love me some BMW, but Amazon\u2019s whole existence depends on the Web. There was a time, if you can fathom it, that BMW was only known through -gasp- print and broadcast advertising. Which is to say that a web presence is not the primary driver in BMW\u2019s business. (Though, I imagine business would be much slower without a really slick web presence.) Correspondingly, I don\u2019t think BMW is pushing any envelopes in online presence.Amazon, otoh, built its very considerable business strictly online, and is itself a driver in web and online technologies. Being involved with such an online heavy-hitter can do nothing but good for your resume.

I was very confused at that time in my life, and the professor said I might be in the wrong class.I've passed the basic math required for my BA degree however. It was challenging for me, but I got good grades. I had to re-take algebra because of my additional placement test score, and algebra ended up being more challenging than math for liberal arts which came after.I learned a few things about calculus by interpreting and asking questions, even though I have never taken calculus. Some of the lectures I had heard from the hallway in high school started to click together, partly because it was the same guy who had taught some of my friends calculus in high school.",

Since you don't know what a salary rate is in your area, I assume you are new to the field, and this is your first data scientist job. Try to look up entry level salary ranges online for data scientists in your area, and be realistic.Your consultant rate for long term contacts (6 months and more) should be your annual salary plus the cost of benefits, and a 10 % or so bump. Convert that to an hourly rate by dividing it with 1800 (number of hours in a year when you take into account holidays, vacation, sick days, etc.) This number often gives hiring managers sticker shock because they compare it to the nominal hourly rate of their employees, which does not account for paid time off. Be prepared to explain that their empress don't actually work 2084 hours in a year.Once you are more established, and are able to tell your next employer how many millions you made or saved your last employer, you can start nudging your hourly rate up, or start billing by the project instead.",

"Answer": "The Universal Approximation Theorem, as far as I know, only claims that single-layer neural networks can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of R^n.A \u201ccompact subset of the reals\u201d is just a subset that\u2019s closed (i.e. [1, 3], not (1, 3)) and \u201cbounded\u201d (i.e. the distance between any two points in the set is less than some number). So, for instance, [1, 3] U [5, 6] is a \u201ccompact subset of R\u201d. In short: compactness is generally a fine assumption for real-world problems.As for proving it can approximate a continuous function, let us first define what exactly we mean by \u201ccontinuous\u201d. Intuitively, a function is continuous if points that are \u201cnear\u201d each other have \u201csimilar\u201d values \u2013 i.e. \u201ca small change in x leads to a small change in f(x)\u201d.There is an incredibly useful theorem, which states that any continuous function can be approximated as accurately as you like by a step function. For example, here is the sin(6x) being approximated by a step function:The smaller you make the steps\u2019 widths, the better an approximation you can get.Alright, now on to neural networks. In one dimension, every input neuron is of the form \u2202(a*x + b), where \u201c\u2202\u201d is some monotone function from -1 to 1 (or 0 to 1, or what have you). Here is a graph of two neurons and what they sum up to:The \u201ca\u201d parameter lets us make these neurons as steep as we like. For instance, if we set a=10 (instead of a=1) for both neurons, we get:So these two neurons added together tell us if x is between 0 or 2. Adding additional pairs of neurons let\u2019s us figure out if x is between any other two points:If we add 16 more neurons (one for [-10, -8], one for [-8, -6], one for [-6, -4], etc.), then the output neuron can look at our neuron-pairs and determine which interval the original \u201cx\u201d is in, and then map it to the correct value. In other words, the output neuron is taking the \u201csteps\u201d that the hidden neurons made and figuring out how high to make each step \u2013 which is starting to sound an awful low like a step function!It does this with the weights it chooses. In the above example, let\u2019s say f(1) = 0.5 and f(5) = -0.5. Then the output neuron would try to say (0.5) * (n1 + n2) + (-0.5) * (n3 + n4). The actual numbers would be a bit different (because the output neuron is also passing its output through a sigmoid function, and \u201cn1 + n2\u201d doesn\u2019t quite hit 1 (it only goes up to ~0.6 in the above example), but the idea still works.Another way to think of this is by thinking of the hidden layer as representing a \u201cfeature expansion\u201d of the input \u2013 it converts an innocent \u201cx\u201d value into a ton of almost-zeros and almost-ones that indicate what steps \u201cx\u201d belongs to. Then the output neuron uses this feature expansion to compute the actual step function.So the argument goes: neural networks (can) approximate step functions which (can) approximate continuous functions. Obviously neural networks can do a lot more than just approximate a step function.Edit: this extends very naturally into higher dimensions, it just takes more than 2 neurons to represent a \u201cstep\u201d. If X is 2D you need 3 neurons. If X is 4D you need 4, etc. This is because you need the dimension\u2019s simplex to properly define the equivalent of a \u201cstep\u201d in higher dimensions.Edit: wow, sorry, I totally missed the word \u201crecurrent\u201d, but since recurrent networks are literally just feedforward neural networks with some extra inputs (ignoring training problems), the same argument should still hold.It's also worth pointing out that in real life a neural network is unlikely to learn something like this step function representation - just because it's capable of representing a continuous function this way doesn't mean it's likely to converge on this solution! And, more to the point, if your network\u2019a first layer does converge to a solution that looks step-functiony, you probably don't want to be using a neural network unless you have a lot more data than you need (I\u2019d suspect you're overfitting otherwise).",

There are a lot of problems that machines can\u2019t yet solve and the data needed to predict some events is so massive and subjective that it would either be inefficient in computational time or quite hard or impossible to interpret by a machine learning algorithm. World wide and even local events can influence the stock market and in order to beat humans the system needs to get the information before the human or at least at the same time and \u201cpredict\u201d the most likely outcome and trade accordingly. For it to take the best action it needs to have enough examples of the event and the conditions that followed, which is not easy at all. Not to mention that some events are in no way the same as others that are from the same family. For example - war. The effects of WWII were MASSIVE on the whole world. The effects of a war between Bulgaria and Macedonia - not at all, like it was invisible.It could be possible, but you would need to have instant access to all the information in the world and perfect interpretation of subjective information, the factors this information is influenced by and what the results of that information are and what they are used for and where.Maybe i am forgetting something, but we\u2019ll see.",

It\u2019s not that you are unable to like any kind of job, every person likes to do a job it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t realize their passion and interests due to stressful boring work environments.Try to do your favourite hobbies which you used to do. You have to bring back your passion by taking some time off, travel, try to realize what you seriously love doing, work towards it and do only what suites you and make sure you have whole heart it int. The job becomes interesting only when you love it not hate it. If you hate the job and you are trying to love it, then either you learn some new things related to your job, or else quit it. Do the job which you can put your whole heart and passion in it. Who knows, not web development but another career which you choose whole heartedly might be more successful than your current job! All the best!",

"Answer": "This problem is most common in people working in IT companies because being a developer leads to writing hundreds of lines of code everyday and that becomes a boring like hell task for them.Frankly speaking there is no way that you can start loving your job. But there is one thing you can do - Spend your evening after job doing things you like no matter how down you are feeling.Go for a walkHangout with your friendsEat your favorite dishGo to nearby disco or pubAnything you like. More you try to keep yourself after working hours, less you feel stressed while in the working hours because you will be excited abt what you are going to do that very evening.Other thing you can do is to change the job or profile.",

"Answer": "Jonathan\u2019s answer was great, Shor\u2019s algorithm used to factor large numbers is one of the few areas where QCs are known to provide an important speedup over classical computers (assuming we can build them sufficiently large).They should also be very helpful in simulating quantum mechanical systems. If you imagine a billiards table, to simulate the table you\u2019d need a few numbers to describe the environment (where the walls of the table are), and then a few numbers for each ball (position and velocity really), and from there you could make predictions about where the balls will be in the future or even where they were in the past. Adding an additional ball to the table would only require a few more numbers, but on a quantum billiards table, each additional ball added will double the number of numbers we need to keep track of the situation. So ten doublings is about a 1,000, so by the time we\u2019ve got 20 billiard balls on the table we\u2019re having to keep track of more than a million numbers for them.And so even as few as a thousand objects becomes completely intractable with classical computers (barring some incredible breakthroughs in either quantum physics, mathematics, or computer science).So simulating physics should be a big advantage for QCs, which should help physicists in a lot of areas, probably things like superconductors and semiconductors, material science, and from there it just branches out: chemistry, protein folding, biology, medicine \u2014 there could be some very important problems in some of these fields that could be aided with simulating molecular level things. Protein folding especially.",

"Answer": "There are a few criterion that will give you a good heuristic for whether a problem is tractable by MLYou might have noticed by now that I seem to be saying that if you have enough data and a well-posed question, you can solve the problem with ML. For the most part, that's true. Gathering sufficient data isn't always easy and posing the question the right way is often hard. Beyond that, we have another problem: computation.Complex problems require a lot of data and a lot of computational power. That's a major limiting factor in modern ML. It means a large difference between \u201csolvable with modern ML\u201d and \u201csolvable with my resources\u201d. Cloud services have shrunken that difference, but it's still very much there.If you want to determine if something is solvable within your resources, just doing a few proof-of concept experiments should be sufficient most of the time. If you want to know if modern ML is capable of solving a problem with, for example, Google-level resources, compare it to modern problems being solved at places like Google. You can run some small-scale experiments on those problems and on yours and compare how their performances change as you increase the scale.In general, a neural network with a single hidden layer can solve any problem (see the universal approximation theorem), at least in the sense that it can fit any function. That doesn't make it the best solution, but it is one. As long as you can pose your question properly and get enough data, modern techniques are usually sufficient. The real difficulties are resources, getting the model to converge, and avoiding overfitting.",

Under that create a package and a class (any name).Step 4: Write your program:````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````Step 5: Set a debug point anywhere inside the program. (For ex: I set at line no. 3)Step 6: Right click on the program and press Debug as -> Java Application.Step 7: Press \u201cStep Over\u201d button or F6. It will show you step by step changing values of num and sum.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014In your case:Answer is : num =1, sum = -3How did we get this1st Iteration) Before: sum = 0, num =-2After: sum = -2, num = -12nd Iteration) Before: sum = -2, num = -1After: sum = -3, num = 0;3rd Iteration) Before: sum = -3, num = 0;After: sum = -3, num = 14th Iteration) Before: sum = -3, num = 1;After: num++ = 2 (num < 1 turns false)Therefore the execution stops here. Thus you get your answer.Note: do-while loop is similar to while loop, however there is a single difference between these two. Unlike while loop, do-while guarantees at-least one execution of block of statements. This happens because the do-while loop evaluates the Boolean expression at the end of the loop\u2019s body.PS: You can use this method of analyzing your code and can solve doubts without asking anyone( from simple to complex)All the best!",

"Answer": "You should probably pick opposite approach: start with basics. Review calculus and probability theory. Most of the people that write those books and tutorials on ML know those foundations so good that they forget that others do not(or simply expect academia readers).Also I dont think you need to understand backpropagation to use it. Abstract overall feel of how it works should do perfectly. I promise you will use some framework\u2019s compute_gradients() function for the 99% of the time.I will try to put here explanation of backpropagation algorithm that appeals to me most.I understand backpropagation as a version of a gradient descent for multiple levels of functions(neurons). I am guessing that you already know what gradient descent is from Andrew Ng\u2019s videos.So here is one neuron, f(x1,x2,x3,w1,w2,w3) as a math function(simplified AF):Lets say we want it to take a, b and c and output y. We define cost function as J(f(x1,x2,x3,w1,w2,w3), y)What we do in this case is:- Simply compute our f(a,b,c,w1,w2,w3) and get some ~y ( so called approximation)- Compute cost gradients (partial derivatives for each weight,\u00a0i.e. how cost function changes dependent on each weight)- and adjust our weights accordingly.So essentially what we do here is take our ~y and look how wrong this approximation was based on each weight.And now lets look at multilayer version of it.Lets try use gradient descent here.Now we have 2 cases for minimization : f5, which is actually the same as we had and the rest. We dont have any wanted outputs for the second case and we simply can\u2019t view it individually.Since gradient descent can minimize cost function for something only if it has defined training input and output lets pick that something on example given.I would say it is some line that connects input and output.Lets consider everything that does not belong to that red line as constants. Then we can rewrite our example asf5(f2(f1(X1))) = YThen our cost functions will look like J(f5(f2(f1(X1))), Y).Since we treat everything but functions we need as a constant we can talk about three weights: w5, w2 and w1 (for each function).Now we should compute the gradients for weights, mostly same as in prior example(partial derivatives).Each weight is embedded in corresponding function.w5We simply compute the output of our network ~Y and then compute \u03b4J/\u03b4w5(~Y,Y)w2 and w1That is the place where problems should start since the previous Y is unknows (lets call it {Y-1})\u03b4J/\u03b4w2(~{Y-1},{Y-1}) = ?How do we remove this {Y-1}?Here comes the trick: remember the chain rule from calculus? It looks like this:(f(g(x)))` = f(g(x))`g(x)` , for all x\u2019sThis rule actually allows us to compute partial derivative of inner function from our top cost function(i.e. how some deep weight affects our final results):\u03b4J/\u03b4w2(f5(f2({Y-2})),Y)e.g.ifJ(f, Y)=(f - Y)^2andf5(x) = (w5*x)then\u03b4J/\u03b4w2 = w5*2*(w5*f2(x) - Y) * \u03b4f2/\u03b4w2if f2(x) = (w2*x) , then\u03b4J/\u03b4w1 = w5*2*(w5*f2(f1(x)) - Y) * \u03b4f2/\u03b4w2 * \u03b4f1/\u03b4w1etc\u2026Bam! Same old gradient descent with gradients computed in an interesting way.And this goes for every weight out there in your network.Sorry if any mistakes are present, still wrapping my head around this too.Hope it helps.",

One of the things he said about these brick walls has always stuck with me.\u201cBrick walls are there for a reason. They give us a chance to show how badly we want something.\u201dNow that you are facing this brick wall with a conceptual difficulty, you have a chance to show how badly you want to understand the theory behind an extremely important algorithm in machine learning. And from the sound of it, you seem like you really want to understand it, so giving up on machine learning entirely does not make a lot of sense to me.From the methods that you have outlined, there is one form of learning that seems to be absent, and that is learning by collaboration and interaction. Thus far, it seems that you are trying to learn this solo, but it seems like now might be a good time to reach out to people who are also learning backpropagation or have already learned it. Ask them questions about what you don\u2019t understand. Work through an implementation of the algorithm together. Work through problems involving backpropagation together. In my experiences, working with others on concepts I have been a little shaky on has been some of the most enriching experiences from a learning perspective. You should never feel bad or embarrassed about reaching out for help.",

Because of the No Free Lunch Theorem, there will be cases where NN won't be the best choice.Second of all, back propagation is a technique used to find an approximation of a solution to NN system. Understanding it well enough in broad strokes so that you can avoid the pitfalls of applying NN is good enough. You don't need to understand it to the point of being able to program back prop. There are a lot of smart people who already do that.Third, NN is slow to train and need a lot of training set examples, so it might not even be the practical choice.It's far more important to know how to go about building a ML model and evaluate it after you build it than knowing the ins and outs of back prop.",

"Answer": "Well, although their development skillset will have some overlap, the underlying knowledge would be different. Keep in mind, the term software engineer is quite a broad field. Within that field you have people who work on strictly windows based systems, then you have desktop app development, mobile app development, web development, embedded systems development and R & D development. I would say machine learning engineer is a subset of engineering in the software engineering scope.It\u2019s probably also worthwhile to understand that there has been significant paradigm shift into how a machine learning engineer can approach a software engineering task/problem. Traditional software engineering principles dictate that a program should be designed by the engineer to input the data and produce an output. However, with machine learning, the engineer doesn\u2019t have to design a solution. He can write some software which generates a program which solves the problem by producing an optimal output. In this instance the machine in effect becomes a software engineer. Although practically, this isn\u2019t for the entire platform, but rather the key problem. However, this is always evolving as ML theory and technology improves, imagine a world where machines write their own programs! Skynet much! I digress\u2026A machine learning engineer needs to know in detail the following aspects:1. Statistical AnalysisThis is super important to understand if the problem actually calls for the use of machine learning techniques. General rule of thumb is, if there is little to no data to use for the algorithm to learn on, then machine learning is not suitable. But this stage is also a data exploration stage, in understanding the nature of the data, what random variables exist, how are they distributed and are they correlated. This is all useful information to decide which algorithms to use. This includes understanding principles outlined in the Glossary of Probability and Statistics. (too many to list)2. The learning relationship:LEARNING = REPRESENTATION + EVALUATION + OPTIMIZATION3. Learning TypesUnsupervised learning is perhaps the most sophisticated approach, and over time, as we learn more and technology progresses, it has huge disruptive potential. Imagine programs learning without any input or guidance from humans. However, supervised learning is the most common from a commercial standpoint. Supervised learning problems get broken down into the following:Machine Learning Engineer as a General Software EngineerIn my experience, hiring a specialist for a general position is a recipe for suboptimal general code. And hiring a general software engineer for a specialist position is a recipe for a catastrophe. However, I must stress the ambiguity surrounding your query about software engineers. It is a general term to describe a large subset of usually specialists. If you were looking for a general software engineer, first identify what platform it is for (mobile [android, windows, ios], windows, linux, embedded) and that should help narrow down your search.The good thing about a well trained software engineer, is that they are adaptable and can learn on the fly. So if you have time, money and patience I am sure many non-specialist can become specialist. Keep in mind research has shown it takes approximatley 1000 hours to become proficient in a new skill set. I would argue it is a bit less for engineers, however, machine learning concepts are highly theoretical and maths heavy, so it could take a little longer.These days with tools like scikit-learn, anyone can learn how to apply machine learning approaches, however, to debug them or improve on the results may take a much deeper understanding.For high level overview of machine learning applications, this is a useful machine learning blog post.If you are interested learning about me and the commercial applications I apply machine learning approaches to, check out HuntedHive\u2019s machine learning consultation page.If you enjoyed this answer, please follow me :)",

"Answer": "No not at all especially since \u2018brush up\u2019 implies that you already have some background in mathematics.Its pretty easy to learn as you go. If you have any knowledge of calculus, statistics and linear algebra. Whenever you come up on a concept you are not familiar with, you can read up on it and understand how it is helping your algorithm.One of the important aspects of deep learning is that for a variety of reasons the math has to remain relatively simple. There are definitely some very involved proofs, but are not necessary for understanding or using neural networks.You can start by reading the Goodfellow et al. book, Deep Learning. The authors really start from the baseline math required for neural nets and work their way up. No brushing up required.",

"Answer": "I would not suggest spending so long on studying math before starting machine learning, because you will likely waste too much time studying unimportant topics.Instead, start with some overview of machine learning [see Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course on Coursera and How do I learn Machine Learning in 10 days?]. Don\u2019t worry if you do not understand the details of the math.Once you are done with the overview, you\u2019ll have a much better idea of what topics in math are relevant for ML. Then go back and study the math, but again, don\u2019t go too deep. See How do I learn machine learning when my math is very rusty?At this point, you should get a decent idea of which area of ML you want to pursue further. Now as you study that particular sub-area of ML, you will have to go and study the math relevant for those specific topics in much greater detail.Related answer:",

Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions. All are controversial.So you don't have to woory about definition let's discuss in a philosophical way-Maths is just like science you didn't have to spend a separate time on it because we all can learn maths from our daily routine. But if the concept is very hard to understand even you have tried your best, then yeah!!! Of course you need to spend some time on it.But one year????For this question, I would say no , because you can't dedicate whole year on maths if you are the student of AI.But I have an idea-You can simuntaneously do both the things I.e. you can learn ai from one side and keep learning maths from other side.Hope you find your required answer.Have a great day aheadThank you.",

"Answer": "It is not the case that quantum computers can invert ALL one-way functions.Quantum computer\u2019s effectiveness in solving One-way functions (Wikipedia) depends on how easily a solution can be checked.In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.This lead-in from Wikipedia\u2019s article on one-way functions uses easy as if it is a well defined category. Quantum computers can invert some one-way functions when its power, based on superposition of entangled qubits allows it to present all possible solutions to logic representing the easily computed function. When that is the case, Grover\u2019s algorithm would reduce the search time from T to square root of T. Further, a clever algorithm might reduce the time by the order of log(T) Clearly many functions we think of as one-way; hashing algorithms for example are not easily handled by a few quantum logic gates. The complexity of the logic involved suggests that it will be some time before maintaining entanglement and superposition for that many steps will be feasible.Even so, success in that stage of the inversion process may not be enough. Once the answer is found, the program must tease the bits of the answer out of the entangled qubit word. Here again Grover\u2019s Algorithm provides a model however its run time is on the order of sqrt(T). For complex cryptographic one-way functions applying the word easy stretches the definition of \u201ccan\u201d a bit.Whether any given one-way function lends itself to a quantum computing program that can solve the inversion in log(T) time would depend on the invention of a unique algorithm just as Shor\u2019s Algorithm solves the factorization problem.",

"Answer": "Nope! But it's a bit complicatedFirstly you cannot prove either without first solving BQP vs NP, which is atleast as hard as P vs PSPACE.Scott Aaronson gave an awesome result, that quantum computers need exponential queries to solve the collision problem, which gives an oracle relative to which SZK is not in BQP. But more importantly, detecting collisions is related to OWFs and easier than inverting them.And with respect to a random oracle with probability one, NP is not contained in BQP. (BBBV)From the above two results it's clear that Quantum One way functions exist! And also that not all classical one way functions can be inverted by Quantum Computers.Now, let's get to why you asked this question: did we ever believe Factoring was a one-way function? It is mentioned so in most old textbooks, it's a textbook example of an OWF. Yes, and we were wrong, and admittedly even Scott Aaronson was first skeptical Quantum Computing for the reason that they can solve the Period Finding Problem exponentially faster than a classical computer. And that is the reason we believed factoring was hard.Now what makes us sure that this won't repeat again? Nothing, PSPACE is the limit, they might be some way of even harnessing petroleum technologies to make super big peg computers that people carry around everyday, or Lucien Hardy gave a good snapshot how Quantum Gravity might influence Quantum Computing and that is still an active area of study.My particular interest is exactly in this, what are the limits Physics puts on Computation! We know limits on data storage, but we still do not have an explanation for why NP Complete problems are unsolvable under any physical model. Or are they solvable? (Sorry Scott Aaronson, I read all of your thesis but I cannot convince myself that some future form of Computation cannot solve NP Complete problems)",

It would seem that nearly every Macbook Pro in the vicinity of New York is used for video-crunching, which is where a 50% speed increase is going to be most notable.If you are only using it to run some version of Office and watch Youtube videos, the 2.0 is probably fine and you\u2019re better off saving the money.You also need to take into account how much of the CPU power is being used by the OS.If you have the Macbook Pro 2.9 GHz loaded up into the latest version of MacWord, and I were to setup my ancient IBM/AT screaming along at 12MHz with DOSWord 5.0b up and running and we were both tasked with creating the same basic text document, there is a very good chance that I could beat you in coming up with the final product (unless the printer were to let me down\u2014there were some laser printers that were very slow in processing PostScript in those days). Where you would win would be ability to process color and include pictures, along with the greater selection of fonts.As soon as I had to fight with the Ribbon Interface in Office2007, I made the decision that 2003 could still do more than I needed and far more easily. In migrating Office2003 from XP through to Windows10, there has been no observable speed improvement. Even the time taken to generate a complete print file seems no faster.",

"Answer": "The 4 Steps of Processing InformationIn every computer program sits a set of instructions. The CPU uses the instructions as a guide to run the programs. To determine what to do with the instructions, the CPU goes through 4 steps to make sure the program runs without errors. The 4 steps are fetch, decode, execute and writeback.Learn Programming at hackr.ioFetch PhaseThe first thing that needs to be done is the fetch step. When the user makes a command to open a program, the CPU receives this request and processes it. The CPU then retrieves the desired program by accessing memory for the program's location. Each program has a program counter number; this is a roadmap that the CPU uses to locate the program and get further instructions from the program.Decode PhaseDecode is the next phase of the process. When a CPU fetches a program, it doesn't see all of the pretty graphical aspects that we see. All it sees is programming code. This code must be deciphered into a language that the CPU understands. There are literally hundreds of different programming languages that programmers use to write software programs. The CPU must first decide what language the program is written in and then decode it so that it understands the instructions that are held inside the code.The decode process is another list of steps. The CPU breaks down the code so that it is manageable. The parts that the CPU deals with are the only ones that directly communicate with it. The opcode (indicates the numerical order of code) is used to figure out the order in which the code must be executed. There are times when a CPU can't interpret the code on its own; so it uses a translator called a microprogram. Once the microprogram has interpreted the code, it sends the instructions back to the CPU in a language that it understands.Execute PhaseNext is the execute stage. After finding the numerical order of the instructions in the code, the CPU is now ready to execute them in order. The program is loaded and made ready for the user. Starting at Step 1, all the components necessary for the program to run efficiently is loaded using the opcode and microprogram, if necessary.Writeback PhaseThe writeback phase is the final one. During each of the previous steps, the CPU records feedback on the process. This is necessary if there was a problem during one of the steps. Even if everything loaded successful, the CPU writes the status back into memory. An example of this is when an error causes Windows to not start properly. After the computer is restarted, the CPU writes the error into memory. When the program loads again, the CPU pulls up the feedback from the last attempt and displays a message to the user. So, that is how a computer processes information; by following predefined steps and instructions inside programming code using the CPU.",

"Answer": "It depends on the language.In C your source code is compiled to machine language - this is a binary set of instructions for the CPU. When you execute the program your operating system loads the executable into memory and then tells the cpu to start executing that code.In an interpreted language like Python, when you execute the source code file, the python interpreter converts the source code instructions into a series of byte code - which are similar to machine code but at not instructions for the CPU, but are instructions for the Python interpreter; in a way these instructions are similar to you entering keys into a calculator.Trying to describe how a compiler works is actually pretty complicated - but essentially a compiler opens the source code files and reads it one character at a time. It keeps track of where it is, and part of the program knows what type of character should be coming next, based on the syntax of the of language - this is so that it both knows what the source code actually means, and can generate an error if required. It will build up a lists of the variable names, functions, and many other things. It uses all that data to work out what machine code or byte-code to create for that piece of source code.",

"Answer": "Our liking for music evolves according to popular culture and our exposure to its different genres. So one way of thinking about AI music directors is that, if (pseudo) random notes (maybe dictated by some rules that restrict the order of their choice of notes based on some scales or so) produced by them is all that we have available for music in the future, we may evolve our tastes to like it.This is already partially present in art. Deep Dream - Online Generator.Computer generated variations on existing music has also been done. Art intersects science: Dabby creates music out of chaos.",

"Answer": "The answer in short is YES.Although there are a ton of companies which are working on artificial intelligence, but some of them stands out because of their commitment and huge amount of investments in R&D. As you may have guessed, these companies are Google and IBM.Google released a song made by artificial intelligence and the project is named \u201cProject Magenta\u201d. Project megenta is handled by a team in Google named \u201cBrain team\u201d which is dedicated to deep learning and machine intelligence. The melody was created by a neural network which was given four notes to start. As I do not know technical terms of music but I can tell you the the music is not the one you will keep in your playlist and play it again and again but it is not that bad either. It is pretty close to average music we listen on day to day basis.To listen to the song hop on to \u201cAttention RNN song sample 1\u201dGoogle is not alone, there are a whole lot of other songs created by other systems.These are some of the other songs composed by Artificially Intelligence Systems:1. Mr Shadow : \"Mister Shadow\" is composed in the style of American songwriters such as Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin and Cole Porter. French composer Beno\u00eet Carr\u00e9 arranged and produced the songs, and wrote the lyrics.2. Daddy's Car : \"Daddy's Car\" is composed in the style of The Beatles. French composer Beno\u00eet Carr\u00e9 arranged and produced the songs, and wrote the lyrics.The two songs are excerpts of albums composed by Artificial Intelligence to be released in 2017. (Description of above two songs.)I hope I was able to tell you exactly what you were trying to ask. If not, feel free to ask in comments.",

Computing is about the practical application of computers to solving real world problems; whereas Computer Science is the theoretical and scientific research into, and analysis of, algorithms, computation and computer systems.In the UK, a Computing graduate tends to write programs for customers, whereas a Computer Science graduate tends to write scientific papers for submission to conferences and journals. I see this as a beneficial split of the practical from the theoretical.In the US, most students tend to get taught a combined CS course, and I think this is detrimental to the US industry. Google needs its fair share of computer scientists, but most employers don\u2019t; they need practical programmers. I\u2019m not sure that many of them are recruiting the people they really need, and I don\u2019t think that copying Google\u2019s recruitment methods is really the right way to find the right people.",

"Answer": "The main idea behind quantum computing is manipulating the power of a phenomena called quantum superposition. This allows particles to be in multiple states at the same time, and hence qubits can be both one and zero simultaneously, as opposed to normal (classical) bits.For example, if a classical computer was being using to crack a four-digit PIN, it must try each combination sequentially, i.e. 0000, 0001, 0002 etc. A quantum computer however could try all possible combinations at the same time, by being in a superposition of all possible inputs.This is clearly much more powerful. The difficulty unfortunately lies in actually obtaining the answer - as the inputs are all being tried simultaneously, the answers are also all merged together. Filtering out the correct answer to find the correct PIN is a difficult problem, and one which makes quantum algorithms so difficult to formulate.",

"Answer": "Efficiency.Let me explain, You run a steady company with 20%YOY growth at 10 employees at production. I am an engineer who have an idea to build a Customised Product for you that learns from your customer\u2019s order history and provide a very effective email marketing. which in turn skyrocketed your sales and to keep up with the demand you hired even more employees. You hired another 20.Now your sales figures are not guaranteed to stay the same for many reasons, but regardless of it you got to pay your 30 employees.now as the sales skyrocketed, its hard to manage the quality effectively. so, my company which specialised in AI, proposed to build a system for you which would increase your producing capacity by 10x at 95% quality rate at the same time requires little or no maintenance and requires only 2 people to run effectively at the cost of electricity bill equivalent to pay check for two employees.So, here you have increased the efficiency of your business which increased your margins, cut down on the employees cost which saved you money and now you are reaching out to your customers in a far better way than you could earlier.AI made you a lot of money in very short period of time. Why would anyone not want that?AI may end up replacing many jobs .But, it may not happen anytime in near future. Let me explain,We are at the exploring possibilities stage of AI. There are tons of possibilities and totally new markets we are creating because of AI. The edge of autonomous AI machine would be a reliable self driving cars. Which can literally think and act but yet to be accepted widely.AI is the definition of future, I believe everything we do today. Including as ridiculous things as pooping, will be touched by AI in some way. Possibilities are huge! But there's one problemUs, as human beings resist the new technology as a part of their natural instincts. A common notion is,Efficiency is in the future.Upgraded iPhone, Macs, a fully automated home etc. new technologies are meant to be efficient in order to be a success. The chances are last device you purchased is 100% more efficient than the previous substitute. That is why you put money to buy it.As per the delta 4 theory, When 40%+ customers out of 100% are retained and accustomed to using the newly introduced technology or product it goes into an irreversible growth period. This applies to every single product and services. If the proportion is less than 40% but greater than 20%, we may need to pour in more money to keep it afloat( ola, uber etc). If it's less than 20%, The business is not worth doing it.With that being said, it's hard to get people out of their defined comfort zone and have them use your services. Trust, is also another factor depending upon your type of business. I think following would be the common challenges for getting people to adapt AI.AcceptanceWhether people/responsible person accept the newly introduced service. Even if they do, how likely is it that they won't go back to the previous traditional service. If we retain 40% of our customers to get used and trust the fully automatic AI with crucial decisions, there's no looking back.EfficiencyHow efficient the new AI product would be? A slightest mistake and it can bring down the years of reputation right at zero in no time. So a highly efficient AI product is pretty hard to design and maintain. Requires a ton of computer intelligence and reliable power.ReliabilityYou are promoting a product which is gonna take decisions by putting billions of dollars on stake with little or no human interaction at all. It will definitely take a lot of time and cost for educating the customers. A business which requires a lot of money to educate the customer is not always a end up being a good one.The FUTUREI believe, AI is gonna be the future. heck, It is the future.But to build something like that, it is undoubtedly gonna take time.People like Ali AlShamsi already knows it's potential and getting their hands dirty by creating their own AI product.I don't see why it won't happen, but I know for sure with keeping all the analytics and current tech trend in mind, it won't happen till late 2030.Thanks for reading.You can learn more about the Delta 4 theory and why it is important for your business explained here.Kunal Shah\u2019s Delta-4 theory \u2014 Explained.",

"Answer": "I am sure you know the obvious uses of AI. Which employer wouldnt want an employee capable of peak performance all day long, with no requirement for vacations or salary hike?But it will also have great impact on the way we view work and life. If everything turns out just right, then we might find ourselves in a position similar to that of elves in stories like Lord of the Rings or Inheritence series. Basically, elves can use magic to summon whatever they desire including food, clothing and shelter. So they dont work for money. They follow their passion. And they usually dont fight with one another because they are self sufficient. AI could be that kind of magic for humanity, if done right.",

"Answer": "As for Now \u201c NO \u201c . As Pedro Domingos, author of the popular ML manifesto The Master Algorithm, writes, \u201cMachine learning is something new under the sun: a technology that builds itself.\u201d Writing such systems involves identifying the right data, choosing the right algorithmic approach, and making sure you build the right conditions for success\u201cThe more people who think about solving problems in this way, the better we\u2019ll be,\u201d says a leader in the firm\u2019s ML effort, Jeff Dean, who is to software at Google as Tom Brady is to quarterbacking in the NFL. Today, he estimates that of Google\u2019s 25,000 engineers, only a \u201cfew thousand\u201d are proficient in machine learning. Maybe ten percent. He\u2019d like that to be closer to a hundred percent. \u201cIt would be great to have every engineer have at least some amount of knowledge of machine learning,\u201d he says.Machine Learning will not eliminate development jobs, but it will change the nature of the software we develop.If you want to understand why, you should definitely read this article in Wired: Soon We Won\u2019t Program Computers. We\u2019ll Train Them Like DogsMost of us grew up with a software development that went like this: write lines of explicit, step-by-step instructions, creating abstractions where necessary to represent complexity. Parse and break down raw data, then synthesise valuable new information as required.What\u2019s changing are our expectations. Not only can the quantity of data a modern application works on be mind-boggingly gigantic, it\u2019s also in highly complex, unstructured formats, like pictures, speech wave-patterns or natural language. The \u2018traditional\u2019 approach to coding is too brittle, it relies on highly proficient software engineers inspecting the data, and then translating their insights into code. It is slow and tremendously difficult work, and it just doesn\u2019t scale.When people talk about Big Data, what they\u2019re really talking about is the set of algorithmic challenges that arise from having to process gigantic datasets.Machine Learning (ML) is not some special magic, but a diverse collection of practical solutions to the problem of processing huge amounts of noisy, unstructured, uncurated data. ML is data-driven, so instead of coding a solution, you give your software a training set of raw data, and out comes insights and predictions.Check the workflow of your favourite software development process, and see if it mentions training. I bet it doesn\u2019t. And if it does, it\u2019s probably referring to what happens when a newbie joins your team.Training, rather than hand-crafting, is the fundamental reason why software that incorporates ML will be built differently from yesteryear - but that doesn\u2019t mean an end to software development. We will still need to create what Oren Etzioni calls \u201cscaffolding\u201d, the software that supplies data to ML processes and utilises its results. Someone to write the user interfaces, the processing pipelines, the operations portals, the data warehousing, the heuristics that define what\u2019s important, and the hundreds of little details that make great products a joy to use.And once you\u2019ve implemented a ML system, how are you going to improve it? More to the point, who is going to improve it?As DeepMind\u2019s Demis Hassabis has said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an art form to get the best out of these systems, there\u2019s only a few hundred people in the world that can do that really well.\u201dNow, does that sound like a dying profession to you, or the dawn of some seriously awesome possibilities? ~ by Jaron Collis, AI PhDGud Luck",

"Answer": "Here's my take:ML work tends to have harder and more interesting challenges, and pays more (but not that much more).Web development (+APIs) allows you to create and scale large systems quickly, with more consciousness and clarity about what you\u2019re doing (as there\u2019s less boundary pushing work), and your competition isn\u2019t as high.Both have challenges, both can offer overlapping sets of work and achievement, but those are the generalized distinguishing factors.How that plays out for you as an individual depends on where your strengths lie, and what you want out of a career.Personally, if I were building a business, I would go for the web development side, as the work is more mechanical, probably still easier to affordably scale, and would allow for more thought about other things.If I were working in a company, I\u2019d probably try to go down the ML route so I wouldn\u2019t become bored (unless I was more interested in strategy and wanted to get on a corporate track).

"Answer": "It also depends on what exactly do you mean by web development. Generally speaking, backend development opens a lot more opportunities for an engineer to extend their career in future in many areas, such as: distributed computing, data retrieval, hardware level software, machine learning and AI etc.Note that ML also requires a significant amount of engineering effort in building backend infrastructure that is capable of scaling these algorithms efficiently.Google Brain team, for example, under Jeff Dean, is currently applying machine learning models to efficiently scale machine learning computations. They build models that learn a lot of metrics at runtime and then use these models to properly scale machine learning computations on Google\u2019s infrastructure. Read their latest papers.So in general, backend engineering opens up a lot more opportunities than traditional web development, but at the same time requires a lot more fundamental knowledge in computer systems design, algorithms and hardware.I spent a lot of time throughout my career learning different technologies and at some point considered myself as a full stack engineer. I thought this is pretty cool because I can do million different things; I'm sort of a Swiss knife\u2026 But then I quickly realized it's actually kinda sucks. You can\u2019t do many things and do all them great.For the last seven years throughout my Google career and now Uber I shifted completely to backend and right now this path brought me to building a scalable data science and machine learning platform in Uber\u2019s marketplace team which is now a part of dynamic pricing engine.",

"Answer": "In long run YES. It\u2019s totally worth it.Career means different things to different people. My answer mainly focuses on the money aspect of it. It may be not applicable if you have different expectations like building your own company.Web Development or any UI development (including mobile or desktop) is a lot in demand because that\u2019s a necessity today. There is a great demand. On the supply side, every Tom, Dick or Harry can learn programming and do basic web development. This also means that it\u2019s quite competitive. Unless you are working for top tech firms it will barely amount to any money or growth is long run.Machine learning at this point has a high demand. There are so many problems ML can solve, it\u2019s just that there are no great frameworks or people with right skill set. Most of the PHD\u2019s who come from statistical background or CS background aren\u2019t great coders. They can prototype stuff but getting anything to production level is still a nightmare. People with great programming skill set don\u2019t have the right tools and knowledge to integrate ML into their day to day stuff. Facebook, Google are trying hard to build in house tools for their engineers to leverage ML in their day to day life. Once application of machine learning crosses some major barriers, there is another whole new dimension to problem solving will emerge.So YES, ML does have better career prospects as of today as compared to Web.",

Therefore, I\u2019ve got a little bit of experience in both areas. I\u2019m not a genius in any of those areas though\u2026Web development is more mature, there is a lot of commodity software/hardware and bigger communities. Therefore it\u2019s easier for an engineer to solve a problem. It pays well as long as you\u2019re competent.However, maturity comes at an expense. Your company offerings can be easily copied because everybody is using the same openly available commodities.And here is where machine learning (ML) kicks in, ML learning is far from being converted into a commodity and it requires more resources to improve a product with ML. Therefore, a product with ML is more difficult to replicate.What\u2019s better? It depends on how you define success in your career.I personally like to work on challenges that make an impact in the company. It makes me feel that I\u2019m helping other people and I absolutely love it.More often than I\u2019d like to, those are non-ML challenges.

Let me say that again Automation of automation. Can you have another generation to perfect the technology and keep your career going longer? Sure but by the time the second generation starts the job prospects will be saturated. Let me point you to a great example:Medical assistant and related \u201ccolleges\u201d. Remember what happened? New colleges lied to potential enrollees from the beginning by lying about the field and job availability. By the time the first batch graduated they found out real quick that the jobs were already dried up and the only ones left were very low paying positions. The hyperinflated the demand.Another example; the auto industry pushed back electric cars with laws and the gravy train was over. The electric car was inevitable. All profit based industries operate under the umbrella of demand but people forget and don't really know that they actually operate on efficiency.

Is that a problem, for example because the first one creates a state in Spring Boot which the second one needs access to? If so, move that state to a place that both instances can access, e.g. a key-value store like redis (see AWS | Amazon ElastiCache \u2013 in-memory data store and cache).

"Answer": "The one and only way is Collaborate with the concerned faculty. First research on the professors under which you want to work ( this is v.v.i.m.p step as you may not get the right person as mentor even in the best universities and i have seen many experiences of people leaving their degree in between as they become directionless as there profeesors are indifferent to them , and also as your branch is like a tough nut to crack , you have to be careful). you can check the webpage of the concerned teacher (Most of the exceptional Professors Have one Clearly defining their Research work and their requirements for a scholar).2. analyze their requirements and work/analyze on a single problem which suits you. start working on that and make a clear roadmap of how to work on that research areas ( Dont be like sherlock Holmes By trying to complete the thesis by yourselves as this is next of impossible by even an experienced person to work alone.3. then contact the concerned faculty for your analysis on a particular project and the way you will be working on that topic.( Note :- as the professors from top universities like YanLe cunn , Andrew NG , Geremy Howard etc are very much Busy , Chances are you may have to wait(or you try to contact to their TA\u2019s other other faculty members / students). but if they accept your initial proposal and reply , you had cleared your first hurdle ,4. now you have to give them Dealing (i.e framing your responses in a way so that you are able to convince the teacher of your worthiness without the teacher is able to know your weakness) this is the toughest part and you have to reply to each question of the professor in cautious and consistent way. if you get his nod (I.E GETTING THE RECOMMENDATION LETTER), YOU GOT A JACKPOTAlso as you have good Academic Record , the Stage -1 ( Establishing the contact will be easier)PLEASE NOTE :- THIS WAY IS MUCH TIME SAVER THAN OTHER CONVENTIONAL WAY ( LIKE DOING THOSE EXPENSIVE CERTIFICATIONS , TIME WASTING DEGREES AND DESIGNING YOUR CV\u2019S ETC) ALSO THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO GAIN A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE WELL BEFORE THE STARTING OF PHD AND THUS IS MORE GENUINE WAY.BEST OF LUCK",

"Answer": "Several catches.Starting salaries might be around $60K for a BSCS, which is pretty good, but you top out at $120K after 10 years. To make more than that, you need to move up into management, go into consulting, start your own company - all high risk endeavors.Work hours are often long. There will always be pressure to work unpaid overtime - some developers are more compressible than others. There is a lot of stress from deadlines and sudden crises. Developing is inherently stressful because you are always confronted with your own mistakes and misadventures, and you can\u2019t rationalize them: computers can\u2019t be socially manipulated.The field is always changing, so you have to keep up. If you don\u2019t make the effort, you will be obsolete within 10 years. You will have to learn about a college course worth of new material every year, forever, on your own time.The biggest catch is that software development is meritocratic and competitive. If you can\u2019t add value, you won\u2019t last. Consistently adding value requires focus, knowledge, skills, and above all talent. There is a talent for writing software, which is hard to define but easy to recognize. If you don\u2019t have it, you won\u2019t last.Most students who try CS don\u2019t stick with it. Most who graduate, don\u2019t stick with software development. Doing a full career as a developer is rare. Ex-developers often make lateral or upwards move and land on their feet, but if they knew they were going to end up in marketing or IT support, they would have been better advised to study that in college.",

"Answer": "Yes, the tech industry is growing, but that\u2019s not the right question to ask. The real question is: to what extent do the marginal returns of having an additional worker in the tech industry diminish?You can imagine two possible extremes here.Scenario 1: The number of different applications in which software can easily and dramatically increase productivity is practically unlimited, so each additional worker in the tech industry always has important problems to solve, and the other software engineers are occupied with their own problems. In this scenario, there is no catch. But it doesn\u2019t sound very realistic, does it? Many people believe that a lot of the newer tech startups aren\u2019t really producing much value for anyone outside Silicon Valley, so the rate of growth we are seeing may not be sustainable.Scenario 2: almost all of the economic value of software can be captured by a small number of highly talented people, because there are a small number of very difficult problems with the potential to dramatically increase productivity across many applications (for example, web search) and the rest of the problems are easy and have much less economic value. In this case, of course, you should expect that competition for easy jobs will drive down salaries relentlessly since the total productivity of all the people who solve the easy problems is not that high.The real truth lies somewhere between the two extremes. Unless you are wildly optimistic about Scenario 1, the conclusion is obvious: you had better be really good at software development if you want your salary to remain high in the long run. Otherwise you will be competing against a lot of other people for a pool of jobs whose total productivity cannot keep growing at the same rate as the number of people interested in software development.And if you\u2019re paying attention, you should see that even now, your job prospects as a fresh CS graduate do actually depend on how good you are. Sure, they\u2019re not bad for people with degrees from a small number of reputable schools, but the competition to get into those CS programs is fierce. [1] If you went to a less reputable school, you can make up for it by taking hard courses like Operating Systems, but it appears that maybe not everyone actually has the ability to do well in Operating Systems (even if only for lack of time management skills, not to say anything about talent).Fresh CS graduates without particular distinction are finding themselves in a situation that is not so different from non-CS graduates\u2014you apply to XXX companies, get only YYY interviews, and only ZZZ offers, where X\u226bY\u226bZX\u226bY\u226bZX \\gg Y \\gg Z.I even know a software engineer with two years of experience at Google who had to go through such a protracted, depressing search for a new job after he quit Google. The problem was that he didn\u2019t learn many transferrable skills in his role at Google.If this is all news to you, maybe you need to pay more attention.[1] That could be either because the school itself is extremely hard to get into (say, MIT) or because the school is not extremely hard to get into but there are strict enrollment controls because of demand for the CS program (say, the University of Washington).",

"Answer": "The catch, is that not everybody can do it well and we haven\u2019t figured out why.You can teach someone programming. You can teach them all the frameworks and libraries out there. You can also force them to do things a certain way so that it\u2019s done well. But by the time someone learns all this, everything becomes outdated.Some hot new technology, framework, library or a programming language comes out. The whole point of this new technology is to prove that everything you have learned so far is pointless. So, you start afresh.This time, you are competing with a cohort of new-comers. They aren\u2019t set in their ways like you. So, they learn really fast. They stick around long enough to be functional with that new piece of tech while you leave the game because of exhaustion because you felt intimidated by those youngsters. Also, you\u2019ve made some money by now. Some was through work. But a big chunk of it came from inheritance. So, you depart into the sunset.Meanwhile, somebody has to do your job. However, this new cohort of developers you just got intimidated by are still learning. Some of them have picked up those skills. They take your job at an age much younger than you were. Those \u201ckids\u201d now set benchmarks for salaries and expectations. Meanwhile, a new tech comes along and the cycle continues.To do well in this rapidly rolling chain of events is quite challenging. In addition, you need a plethora of soft skills so that those who pay you, don\u2019t mind keeping you around. This is something people talented at learning tech, struggle with.",

"Answer": "I don\u2019t agree with your colleague. Tensorflow isn\u2019t exactly a machine-learning library: it\u2019s a library for optimization and symbolic algebra, in particular for vector/matrix operations. It was designed for deep learning (deep neural networks) but can be used for other types of problems too (e.g. GPflow). Of the low-level neural network libraries, I think Tensorflow is the easiest to learn from scratch, but that\u2019s mostly because of the wealth of documentation available.If you know some basic Python and want a very simple machine-learning library, look at scikit-learn. It\u2019s well documented and very intuitive (each algorithm is a class, you instantiate that class and use it\u2019s fit and predict methods).",

"Answer": "All of the frameworks aim at being easy to get started. You can do a couple of tutorials and think that you are done exploring Tensorflow.That is not the case. First thing to understand is that TF is not about python at all, it only has a Python API for scripting. You should know that nothing you code will actually mean something until you create a session to execute it in the underlying core code (which is not in Python).Secondly, it will probably take you 15 minutes to be able to build a graph and train it on MNIST to get arbitrary acccuracy. When you decide to mix things up and do, for instance, instance segmentation with Virtual Adversarial Training on N parallel gpus and monitor gradients in a debug session to see which layer does the lds loss become NaN.. then you probably have 2\u20133 months of trial-error, github issues, stackoverflow, quora trips ahead of you..The easiest in terms of modularity and ease of prototyping is Keras. It recently been made the official high level API for Tensorflow (one of its backend engines was already TF)",

"Answer": "I would say that TensorFlow is the easiest deep learning framework out there. There are of course, different data science/machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn that are arguably easier than TensorFlow. However, Tensorflow sets itself apart from the competition because of its relatively easy to use framework for neural network training. Tensorflow excludes a lot of annoying and unneccesary verbosity, while having a simpler platform to add layers and optimize models.Another relatively easy deep learning library would be Keras, although it is more general purpose than Tensorflow. All in all however, you won\u2019t get too far with Tensorflow or any deep learning framework for that matter with just your CPU alone, so if you are just getting started, I would recommend some statistical machine learning/data analysis.",

I\u2019m assuming the second option is what you mean.According to Structured program theorem, the minimal set of language features needed to solve any computable problem areWhich would make looping only one of three important features. Since all three are claimed to be needed, no single one can be called the most important. One strike against your friend.If we go down to the assembly language/machine code level, not all CPUs have had an explicit loop instruction. Some of them only had branching and jumps. You can implement iteration (and calling code blocks) with those two concepts, so it seems not to be the most essential feature at the machine level. Strike two against your friend.As Dijkstra pointed out in his \u201cGoto considered harmful\u201d essay, loop instructions are redundant since recursion is possible, can be used in place of iteration (and for much more, besides). Quite a few functional languages have no loop control structure at all. So while it might be useful, it\u2019s not essential. Strike three.Maybe it\u2019s the most important feature to your friend. That\u2019s his prerogative.Of the three features identified in the Structured Program theorem, I think \u201ccalling code blocks in sequence\u201d might win, since it is essential not only to Structured programming but also functional programming. In fact, the ability to define a function, apply it to a value and feed the result to another function is all you need for Lambda calculus (although typed versions of the calculus are more easily usable). With that, it\u2019s been proven that you can compute anything that can be computed.So the most important function of programming languages is\u2026 functions.",

"Answer": "Actually, there is no single most important function. The function importance is strongly dependent on the problem you are solving. Moreover, the functions are usually bound to some framework built on top of the language, e.g. .NET, Java (language and framework), ..On the other hand. Each programming language shares some common traits. These characteristics are the basic building blocks of any program you will possibly build. Therefore I can safely say, that these basic blocks are the most important thing in any programming language and you should fist focus on them.Now lets iterate over these blocks.ConditionsTo control the flow in your program you always need some form of condition to decide what to do next. These are commonly represented as if / else, in some cases as switch.LoopsAny complex program contains recurring work. It can be as simple as iterating over the numbers and computing the sum, or it can be very complex as computing the tax money for all countries over the world. In both cases the program repeat the same work over and over. Again these can be in multiple flavors, for and while are the most common.VariablesIn the real world, you need to store things for later use. The storage depends on the type of the object you are storing. It can be bookcase for books, shoe stand for shoes or garage for car. The same goes for programming languages. In any program you will need to remember something and the storage depends on the type of the stuff.The storage is called variable, and the most common types are numbers (int, float), strings to store text, structures for complex data, objects for modelling real world objects.Subroutines / FunctionsOnce you start building complex programs, the code starts to get messy and you start figuring out, that you are using the same set of command over and over again.To reuse everything what can be reused, you group the commands to function. The functions are a great way to organize your program and encapsulate the complex functionality. At the core, the principle is quite easy, but writing good function is not a trivial task. And I would recommend learning from some online course.And that is it. These are the most basic building blocks of any programming language and of any program ever written.",

"Answer": "In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a \"learning machine\" which would parallel the principles of evolution. Computer simulation of evolution started as early as in 1954 with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli, who was using the computer at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His 1954 publication was not widely noticed. Starting in 1957, the Australian quantitative geneticist Alex Fraser published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection of organisms with multiple loci controlling a measurable trait. From these beginnings, computer simulation of evolution by biologists became more common in the early 1960s, and the methods were described in books by Fraser and Burnell (1970) and Crosby (1973). Fraser's simulations included all of the essential elements of modern genetic algorithms.- Genetic algorithm - WikipediaIn other words, yes, but we\u2019re, like, 70 years late to the party :DThis was thought up pretty much immediately after modern computers were thought up (and, it seems, by the same guy, too).",

There is no concept of array in assembly language, and hence no array index. So the memory address is accessed by what we call reference addressing mode, similar to the second. So when your assembly code is converted to binary object code, no matter what you actually wrote, the second statement will be created, even if you involve some precalculation.So in the end both will produce same result at same time!Thanks for the A2A!",

"Answer": "There are lots of different GC techniques.For the best book on the subject read The Garbage Collection HandbookFor a superb glossary see the Memory Management ReferenceMost broadly you have tracing and reference counting collectors. Tracing works by searching the reachable part of the heap to find all live objects and implicitly regarding everything else as dead (garbage). Reference counting works by counting references to objects in order to identify dead objects as those with no references to them. These two approaches are duals of each other as explained by Cheng et al. in https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs4...Naive tracing algorithms let the mutators (user threads) run for a bit, then stop them all and trace all live objects. This gives a worst case stop-the-world pause proportional in length to the number of live objects. This is easily avoided by tracing the heap incrementally using Dijkstra\u2019s tricolor algorithm which allows you to reduce the batch work down to tracing a single object at a time, i.e. submicrosecond pauses. However, fine grained incremental tracing decreases throughput significantly so most production GCs incur pauses of 10\u2013100ms to keep throughput high.Naive reference counting recycles dead objects immediately when their reference count is decremented to zero. When the last reference to the root of a directed acyclic graph (e.g. tree) is decremented then every object in the entire graph must be decremented to zero and collected in a loop which results in a stop-the-world pause proportional to the number of objects in the graph. This is easily avoided by deferring decrements and doing only a few at a time. However, one of the major advantages of naive reference counting is promptness and deferred reference counting sacrifices this advantage. For example, Mathematica is a great computer algebra system but its reliance upon naive reference counting can make it pause for several seconds while it recursively deallocates large symbolic expressions.Another important class of GC algorithms you might want to look at are the real-time GCs. These guarantee to allow mutators to run for a given proportion of total wall clock time, a proportion known as the \u201cminimum mutator utilization\u201d. Thus they are suitable for hard-real-time problems. However, typical mutator utilization is atrocious compared to a production GC (e.g. 50% vs 95%).Last I looked (which was many years ago) the state-of-the-art for pause times was the parallel, concurrent and real-time collector called Staccato: http://researcher.watson.ibm.com...I wrote a blog post about Classifying garbage collection algorithms",

"Answer": "The ones I remember right off\u2026#2 is often used, but it can have problems with memory fragmentation depending on the size and frequency of allocations while running.#3 provides the best recovery as the entire pool is usable, and fragmentation minimal (copying allows for compacting data). It also is rather slow.#4 attempts to match performance between #2 and #1. BUT it has problems with fragmentation, and lost nodes. Consider a buffer ring; since each element contains a minimal count except the reference to the ring, which has a minimum of 2. Deallocation of the ring should happen when the reference is deallocated, but now each element of the ring still has a reference of 1. Thus the ring is lost. I believe Java attempts to prevent the ring structure from existing, thus making possible use of #4.#2 and #3 were used in LISP interpreters since about 1975. I think LISP used #1 in early implementations. #4 could be used in LISP, but I don\u2019t know if it currently is.There may be more (one was called swapping, but that is related to #3, but used a disk for the alternate pool).",

If you\u2019re passionate about computer science, problem solving, and/or mathematics, it would be a reasonable bet that you would enjoy artificial intelligence and in that case it is a good idea to study it. However, if you don\u2019t enjoy mathematics or computer science, it may not be a good idea to study artificial intelligence. So in order to answer this question for yourself, you should ask yourself some questions about what you enjoy doing. Here\u2019s some questions that can get you started:If the answer is no to all of these questions, I would not recommend studying artificial intelligence, but if you can say a definite yes to at least one of these questions, I would say go for it. Artificial Intelligence is an amazing field that really demonstrates how a lot of modern technology works.

"Answer": "No.It does have an exact value in the usual sense of the term. Usually when we speak of the exact value of a trig function, we mean that we can write down for its value a finite expression combining integers using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root taking (usually square roots). We can do that for sin(2\u03c0/7)sin\u2061(2\u03c0/7)\\sin(2\\pi/7) in the way we can for say sin(\u03c0/3)=3\u203e\u221a/2.sin\u2061(\u03c0/3)=3/2.\\sin(\\pi/3)=\\sqrt{3}/2.   So in the usual sense, yes.By this definition, we\u2019d say x5=3x5=3x^5=3 has an exact answer, x=3\u203e\u221a5,x=35,x=\\sqrt[5]{3}, but x5+x=3x5+x=3x^5+x=3 doesn\u2019t. It was Galois who figured out how in general to determine if a given polynomial has exact zeros by this definition.When you think about, it\u2019s a pretty arbitrary definition. Other definitions of exact are possible. If we allow trig functions, then sin(2\u03c0/7)sin\u2061(2\u03c0/7)\\sin(2\\pi/7) is exactly sin(2\u03c0/7).sin\u2061(2\u03c0/7).\\sin(2\\pi/7). This seems facetious, but our real numbers are full of vacuous arithmetic. What\u2019s \u03c0+e\u03c0+e\\pi+e? It\u2019s \u03c0+e.\u03c0+e.\\pi+e. There\u2019s not really a better answer in our real number system.We might say we have an exact answer when we can write down a polynomial with integer coefficients one of whose zeros is the answer. In that sense, sin(2\u03c0/7)sin\u2061(2\u03c0/7)\\sin(2\\pi/7) is exact, being one of the zeros of 64x6\u2212112x4+56x2\u22127.64x6\u2212112x4+56x2\u22127.64 x^6 - 112 x^4 + 56 x^2 - 7. That\u2019s a cubic in x2,x2,x^2, which is why we can say it has an exact answer in the usual sense. If it was a fifth degree or higher, it might not.To work these out (cosines are easier) we write something like sin(4t)=\u2212sin(3t),sin\u2061(4t)=\u2212sin\u2061(3t),\\sin(4t)=-\\sin(3t),  true for t=2\u03c0/7,t=2\u03c0/7,t=2\\pi/7, and use the double and triple angle formulas, replacing cosine squared with one minus sine squared when it appears, and eventually we get that polynomial, where x=sin(t).x=sin\u2061(t).x=\\sin(t).My belief is that the zeros of x5+x\u22123x5+x\u22123x^5+x-3 are just as exact as those of x2\u22122.x2\u22122.x^2-2. Just because we\u2019ve invented a notation for the latter, 2\u203e\u221a,2,\\sqrt{2}, doesn\u2019t make it more exact. They\u2019re each a pot of gold at the end of some infinite calculation. Being finite beings with finite time and finite space, we can never finish that calculation, so all we ever can get are rational approximations in either case. This is a deep and fundamental fact that we just gloss over when we blithely write 2\u203e\u221a.2.\\sqrt{2}. I\u2019m a computer programmer. When my calculation doesn\u2019t terminate, that\u2019s a bug.The term for folks like me is finitist or rationalist. I\u2019ve come to the belief that the real numbers aren\u2019t real at all. The name \u201creal\u201d is a marketing breakthrough, a more successful brand than Coke. The number system that truly exists, the primary field of mathematics (in the group theory sense), is the rationals.No, you object, we\u2019ve constructed the reals out of the rationals. A real is an infinite decimal. A real is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences. A real is a Dedekind cut. I\u2019m here to tell you none of those constructions are logically sound. They all rely on things known to have problems. We assume we can make all subsets of an infinite set. We assume the Axiom of Choice, where we can make an infinite number of choices and go on. We assume that infinitely long predicates make sense. In this answer, where I misunderstood the question, I show a bit of what happens when you try to construct e.e.e. The constructions don\u2019t work.Textbook authors generally recognize this. Look at the beginning of your calculus text. Calculus as currently construed requires the real numbers. At the beginning of your text there will be a couple of pages giving you the Axioms of the real numbers, basically the field and order properties along with a least upper bound axiom. These are not proved, they are assumed. These are not the result of a construction of the reals. They are wishes, properties we\u2019d like our number system to have. Ah, if only wishing made it so.Mathematicians stamp folks like me with the label \u201cfinitist\u201d and go on with their work as if the foundations of mathematics don\u2019t matter. But foundations matter most. The first steps we take are the most important. We\u2019ve built a house of cards. Page through a math journal and look at the papers that depend on the reals. Each of those is suspect, relying on properties of a number system that have not been logically demonstrated.So, by my view, trigonometry is deeply wrong, relying on square roots and transcendental functions we can never compute. You see it in the Quora answers; students are content to give approximations as answers. You see it in the Quora questions, where 99% of the examples are 30,60,90 and 45,45,90 triangles. How did we ever buy into a system that has only two examples? I lobby to add 72,18,90 as a third occasionally, but that doesn\u2019t change the point. Fields of mathematics should be teeming with examples.OK, I\u2019ve ranted enough for a Monday morning.",

"Answer": "Hi,I am sanidhya here to help you. First of all be sure that I amn't any expert in AI but have interest in providing motivational answers.So here comes the answer.Wow! You\u2019re well on your way! You certainly don\u2019t need any degree to become an \u201cexpert\u201d in AI (or any other field). However, if what you want is to land a high paying job and/or become well-known in the field, then, yes and advanced degree can help a lot. When I was executive director of the NYNEX AI lab back in the mid-80\u2019s through the 90\u2019s, I hired someone for the AI lab with only two years as an undergraduate and it was the right decision, but there aren\u2019t many hiring managers like me. ;) Typically, a Ph.D. will come with both a higher salary and more independence about what you http://do.AI problems are difficult and if one of your goals is to advance the field, you will most likely need to work as part of an interdisciplinary team. For that reason, communication skills such as writing, speaking and *listening* skills can also prove invaluable. If you are *interested* you might find it worthwhile to learn something about neuroscience and/or cognitive psychology.Solving a specific AI problem does not require that the solution be anything like how humans do it, but it can still be a source of ideas even if humans serve as a \u201cbad example.\u201d You might try Kahnemann\u2019s book \u201cFast and Slow Thinking\u201d or Dan Ariely, \u201cPredictably Irrational\u201d which are quite accessible and have worthwhile information on how people work which will be valuable to you in life apart from your profession but can also help you determine whether you are interested in the psychology side of things. It is clear that for AI systems to be successful, they need to be designed with human beings in mind. Along these lines, you might enjoy my *fictional* scenarios about possible ethical, political, economic, and social implications of AI in \u201cTuring\u2019s Nightmares.\u201d Good luck!http://tinyurl.com/hz6dg2d.Visit here to explore more about it.6 TED Talks on artificial intelligenceHope you got the answer if you have any other confusion then ask for it in the comment section.Thank you",

"Answer": "That depends on which *style* of AI you think will win big in the future.I am working on the bleeding edge, and it is not the usual bleeding edge. So I will give you advice from my perspective. It is unconventional.That sequence is how we got to where we are today \u2026 with one caveat. The neural nets field went dark for a while, then resurfaced as Deep Learning. And when Deep Learning arrived, it suddenly became clear that the extremists who took over AI in the late 1980s \u2014 the ones represented by the Russell and Norvig textbook \u2014 created a period of over 20 years (1987 to 2007) when the progress was garbage (essentially, the only progress was that the computers got faster and masked the fact that no new ideas were coming out of the AI labs).Summary. We are at a peculiar point in the history of AI. If you want to live in the past, read Russell and Norvig. If you want to ride the Deep Learning bandwagon, feel free to learn all the neural nets you can and go with that. But be warned that if I have any say in the matter, the DL bandwagon will be replaced in the next few years by something radically new, and require an extremely deep understanding of cognitive psychology AND neural nets. You can ignore that advice if you want. But don\u2019t come crying to me if you find you ignored the advice and wasted your time.Good luck.",

I am sure most of us are addicted to Quora enough so to notice this glitch. Do you remember seeing the below error?But what happened to the lives of Quorons? NOTHING except that we had to wait for couple of hours to resume using Quora. That's it! Yes, we can live with software bugs, be it a functional issue or an operational error, and Life Goes On!Because Software bugs are not as dangerous as airbag defect which I mentioned above where metal shards penetrated face and neck of several passengers.Bottom line - Even a minor bug could be game-breaking in the mechanical and similar industries unlike software industry where the release criteria is \u201cNo open Critical and High severity defects.\u201d but Minor and Trivial defects can be released!Thanks for reading. Please share your thoughts in under comments.EDIT \u2013 Thanks readers for all the excellent comments with examples of severe software bugs.

Worse yet, inexperienced 20-year old hackers are considered to be equal (if not better) \"engineers\" than their older colleagues who were in the field for 20-40 years.\u00a0 That, and the cult of \"superstars\" who managed to produce something which got sold for lots of money - even if their product is crap and falls apart every time somebody fails to pronounce the incantation correctly.This is, to a large extent, is the result of the get-rich-quick mentality of the VC-funded start-ups, and the failure of the real software engineers to behave like members of a profession (i.e. establish the code of professional ethics and professional standards) and leaving the establishment of professional credentials to the academics (who by and large have zero clue about actual engineering).",

"Answer": "Any hardware that is designed to run software, if often pretty generic and is not a complete design.When software is developed for that hardware, all the hardware faults will be caught during software testing.Say an DAC is attached wrongly in board design. When we develop software, we'd check that certain event must generate sound. Nobody would jump to check DAC. We'll check IO lines, is the speaker mounted correctly, is the software configuring device correctly. When nothing would solve the problem then the hardware will be looked at.The conclusion would be that no beep sound because DAC connected wrongly. But the bug identified would be - Software not producing beep sound, software not producing music sound, video plays without sound, audio plays without sound.Once we were working with an ethernet device. Software stack all ported, interrupts hooked, timers running, whole stack printing successfully transmitted msg but on the other side, no data. Not even ping caused anything. After going through the stack, software driver, low level driver everything, it was found that ethernet data lines were swapped that D0 -D7 connected to D8-D15 and vice versa. Ethernet is little endian, we were sending little endian but hardware was making it big endian.Another problem is that hardware guys just don't accept their fault.\"we did it all right check your software.\"Application guy says \"I am doing I right. Check your driver.\"And the one in the middle ie driver developer gets blamed. He has to debug app to make sure his data is right and app is doing it wrong. He also has to gather CROs to make sure the test points on the board are screwing it up. And for some reason, driver development team's manager is big pussy, accepts the blame and asks you to be doubly sure before we transfer the blame.And driver guy works from CRO to MFC classes and windbg in the middle (in case of windows)Then software allows a lot of changes to be made. Reinterpret the same data in a different way and present it differently. It cant be done in hardware. A change request or saying lets use 3 DACs means changing physical components, redo the layout, redoing the PCBs , its major cost shift.But software change means few extra weekends of some over burdened guys working overtime hoping to get compensatory offs, if things went smoothly.",

It all depends on which autorefractor and the skills of the person doing retinoscopy.To be honest, I cringe when I hear of spectacle prescriptions coming straight from an auto-refractor. It is always much better to use one or the other as a starting point and refine the numbers with a series of comparisons, as long as the person being tested is able to give responses.",

"Answer": "Hello Brother.Your marks are pretty good. With these marks one can get admission in mostly every college.Most colleges do not consider your 12th marks as a high priority. Since few years Universities are focusing more on in-prompt knowledge, or say your performance in the Interviews they set for the students. Because of course, marks scored on a written paper are not important than your smart and quick answers during the interview. I think with these scores, you can easily crack into many colleges, just focus on the personal interview.Other than B.tech, you can also per sue BCA. It focuses on computer fundamentals, then specific study of electronic devices\u201dits integrated chips\u201d, multiple programming languages. Its totally programming oriented course you might like, as you like computer stuff.Thanks !",

Well I have waited for more than 2 hours on that day for face to face round with the manager.After waiting for such a long time , I went to washroom got freshened up and then moved into pantry. There I took a coffee for myself and sat in a corner on a couch. There at that moment I saw a tall guy ,fair and handsome come into pantry. Then I looked at my watch to find out that it was 09:40 in the night. I was frustrated and uttered the words \u201c oh my god, f@#k this interview\u201d. The tall guy looked at me and I asked himMe: \u201cDid you also come for the interview?\u201dOther guy: \u201cNo, I actually work here.\u201dMe: \u201cOk! so do you have any idea when that manager comes and starts the interview.\u201dGuy: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will be there in time.\u201dMe: \u201cThis is too much, I wish I have never come here. You know what I actually came here for time pass and I wont work for more than 3 months. I have other plans and did not like staying at home till that worked out.\u201dGuy: Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s almost time and he (manager) will be here soon. All the best!Finally my turn came and I went into the interview room and I was shocked to see the manager. He was the same guy that I talked to a few minutes back. I became dead dumb and did not talk anything. He greeted me as if nothing happened and took the interview and at the last he asked me 2 questions.Q1: Do you know anything about our company?Ans: It was a No from me.Q2: We are expecting a long term relation with the company from your side.Ans: My answer was yes, sure. (But he already knew the answer\u2026.hahaha)Then he asked me to leave for the day and as expected I was not selected.But this experience gave me an insight into the Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s in an interview. For everything during interview there is some hidden reason..for ex: they make us to wait to test our patience and how energetic we are after so long time.(Well, this happened during the time when I just started to search for some jobs where I can also spend some time on other plans)..So this was my experience!!!!!!!",

"Answer": "Full stack means different things to different people. Mostly because of the ambiguity of where the stack starts and ends, and the stacks varies depending on the type of application you are building.At the most basic level, e.g. building a WordPress blog, a full stack would mean, knowing some HTML, CSS, javascript/jquery, and PHP + MySQL + Apache tomcat + SFTP/FTP. And probably some SEO, Google analytics etc.At a slightly more advanced level, e.g. building an interactive SPA, a full stack can mean good knowledge in some of the popular front-end and web frameworks (e.g. angularJS + express, react + relay, laravel, Django, scalajs + play, etc) , at least a few databases, and also the typical build/tool chain, source control, as well CI for the respective stack.Good to also know about related technologies useful for specific use cases such as the message queues, caching (e.g. redis, memcache), job scheduling/pipeling, etc.A more complete stack should also include the appropriate knowledge in deploying the application in cloud services like AWS, google cloud, heroku, etc. As well as knowledge and best practices in scaling, load balancing, monitoring, virtualization/containerization, etc.Essentially, a full stack should have sufficient knowledge to build a specific type of application, from design to development to deployment. The stack itself is dependent on the type of app you are building.Node.js is a revolutionary technology, making it a hot skill to possess for the immediate and near future of modern web application development. Node.js ensures high performance and better responsive features for website from server side to front-end. This has led to Node.js developers being in high demand by the industry which has surpassed all major web development frameworks present in the market like PHP, .NET, etc. This rise and trend can be seen from graph below and hereAnyone who wants to start his career in advance Web Development or Backend development and has interest in working with big technologies like real time communication, live streaming, cloud computing and load balancing in his portfolio can start this training.This Graph is likely to accelerate further in coming years. NodeJS and MongoDB are highly scalable that makes it perfect platform for companies/websites that expect millions of users or millions of transactions and the its the best technology if your site has a lot of realtime communication (like Facebook) or lot of live messaging(like WhatsApp).Average salary of a MEAN stack developer in INDIA is 6 LPA and Average salary of a MEAN stack developer in US is $142000.Full stack JS developers are being hunted by companies like Amazon, Salesforce,Intel, Uber, Goldman Sachs and even growing B2C startups like Paytm and Flipkart. So, This is the best technology stack of present and coming years.edWisor.com is one such platform that which provides mix of live and online training in career path of your choice in IT sector from professionals with industry experience. There is a gamification of learning process where you can learn at your own pace and acquire professionals skills as demanded by the industry. Experts from the industry mentor and help them learn the tricks involved with the job roles.Also there are over 100+ companies that are hiring edWisor trained candidates as interns/full-time role.",

And most of our opinions or methods are developed through all the mistakes we make and amount of time we invest fixing or debugging them.So, 1 year is definitely not enough to master a broad spectrum that is full stack development.Give it 2\u20133 years. Even then, ask if you're good at what you do rather than what all you can do.",

"Answer": "Although we may not realize it, Artificial Intelligence already plays an integral part in our lives. It is used to automate information gathering, performing tedious tasks and even help us out in our lives with tools such as Google Voice, Siri and Alexa. The future implications however, are not as straightforward as it is very hard to predict how far AI will go in the next few decades. There is a strong possibility that we have machines as intelligent as humans in our lifetime, and their influence will be much greater than any other form of AI, for the better or worse.The ultimate goal is to have machines that can teach itself, or \u2018machine learning\u2019 as it\u2019s called. Once that\u2019s done, machines will be able to take over a majority of jobs which we do right now. No matter which way you look at it, we humans are an inefficient bunch. We tend to make mistakes a huge percentage of the time, which in certain fields can be very expensive (like medicine for example). This is where AI can take over and perform the same tasks with much, much greater efficiency with very little chance of mistakes. Sounds great, right? But then there raises another questions, If AI is pretty much better at everything than us, then what would we do? We would lose millions of jobs in the hands of AI as corporations would obviously prefer the cheaper and efficient labor of AI.Artificial Intelligence could also potentially find cures for AIDS and Cancer. Machines can attend to vastly more information and more complex processes than human beings, and try out more drugs or vaccines than we can in the lab. Machine learning is used to discover drugs by simulating the process on a computer, which takes a fraction of the time and cost. The thing that makes the AIDS virus so difficult is that it mutates very quickly. But with AI you attack it in different places at the same time. But to discover all those places takes a scale of data processing and hypothesis testing humans can\u2019t do. In the longer term, picture an outbreak of a new disease, like the next Ebola. In the future, the virus will get sequenced very quickly, and then labs will find the vaccine or cure and your immune system will download the instructions for the cure from the Internet into your body, without you even necessarily being consciously aware of it.It could also help government agencies like NSA go through tons of data. The NSA might have a few petabytes of data, which is impossible for any group of people to go through. This can be fixed using AI which can go through this vast amount of information in a few seconds and provide only the significant information to the user. There are also reports of \u201cintelligent weapons\u201d that could have an accuracy of 99.25%. Imagine using something like that in a war. Obviously the country with AI on it\u2019s side would have a HUGE advantage.Finally, we can already see certain forms of AI taking part in our lives, like self driving cars and stuff like google home being able to control your home with just your voice. All of this has a long way to go, but I would like to quote something I read on National Geographic but can\u2019t recall where.\u201cMore generally, I think machine learning, like other technologies, gives you a kind of superpower. Telephones let you communicate at a distance; airplanes let you fly. Machine learning will be the ultimate superpower.\u201dHumans tend to adapt their surroundings onto themselves but AI can adapts itself to you. A lot of the problems we face like today\u2019s information overload can be solved using AI, but will be the trade-off for that much power in the hands of probably the stupidest species in the universe? We can only know that when it\u2019s too late I\u2019m afraid.",

"Answer": "I\u2019m going to write this slightly prejudiced, but I made the transition myself almost 17 years ago, so I think I can give some good advice to this.First, take the way you think of addressing your scripts and flip it on its head. When you're working with JS it's important to get something rendered as SOON as possible, then when you can render the next piece, you do it instantly, in this way you switch back and forth until the page is completely rendered and its complete and your programs done.Working with a scalable backend is exactly the opposite, you start handing the request, dispatch off everything you need to complete the request, and until ALL of those pieces come back, you forget about it. You not only forget about it you take the request and stick it someplace and come back to it every so often JUST to check on its promises. Once ALL the promises are complete, THEN you switch to it, then you build a response, marshall all your objects, and send off the response, and then you go back to doing everything else. There\u2019s always plenty of everything else to be done.You also learn things about caching, about how to abandon a request in midstream, building race processes, how to retrieve and integrate data from multiple data stores, how to do things like aggregate multiple services responses into a single response (often using an intermediate service), even using frameworks or building your own intermediate services that cache intermediate responses to offload that work for you. You learn to do everything you can so that the service that\u2019s sitting in the firehose does as little as possible until it's time to respond with all the work that your backend has done for you. That\u2019s how the webapp that\u2019s responsible for dispatching services into the backend has to work.And it has to do that task on dozens of different servers at the same time, all connecting into the same backend, talking to similar orchestrators and services, and all managing cache, retrieving data, and using algorithms and other tricks to minimize the requests, or hit the cache instead of actually forcing a database query. You have to learn to make tools to turn a system like this on, or off, warm it up, or restart it without losing open connections. You\u2019ll have to learn how to work in the cloud, which, after working in the browser, is not honestly that bad. You\u2019ll learn to work directly with databases, with SQL, with noSQL, with messaging servers and Enterprise Service Buses.But honestly, many years ago I worked on browser software that was designed to present a seamless ecommerce experience on IE6, Netscape 4, and Opera with a sub 5 second rendering time, occasionally rendering XML through XSLT. Most of the things I listed above are easier than that was.Good Luck, and welcome to the Dark Side. Have a cookie.",

"Answer": "The question seems to suggest that anybody who can code can just build a startup. It's a popular perspective in the software sector.I have done both and the two require very different skill sets. Each of which are equally essential.What's more is that you certainly don't learn how to start a successful software company just by writing code.It's true that some people can make the leap from dev to founder, but the notion that anyone can build a startup from developer skills is a dangerous oversimplification. After a successful software development career I had to spend a decade working on sales, marketing, product management, project management, etc to learn the skills I needed to understand the various parts of the business. And I was still far more out of my depth than I expected to be when I first founded a startup.For those looking to do it more quickly, I recommend spending your own spare time prototyping and then joining forces with a non-technical founder who can take on those other areas.Mind you, having a co-founder is always a good idea anyway, and finding a great one with prior experience will be key to your success.In short; just writing code isn't enough to build a startup; it takes a lot of time, research, domain expertise, money, pitching skills, contacts and (usually) help.That's my experience anyway. I do hope nobody finds this discouraging, it's a fantastic journey and always worth taking - just best when well prepared!",

"Answer": "Data scientists learn about data. They do not learn about big. Many do not learn about developing, god forbid designing software.My background is in (one of) the biggest non-commercial fields of data analysis: LHC and its computing grid. Hate to burst a bubble, but I would not trust most of our people to handle more than one server at once by themselves. We are trained for finding answers to problems, not for formulating these answers efficiently. Especially not in a distributed, concurrent, asynchronous, massively parallel way.The very largest fraction of data engineers get by because they do not have to scale. They do not have to scale because there are some competent developers doing the chores. If someone hands you map reduce, the grid, dynamically allocated cloud resources, and all the tools and frameworks, you must be a moron to mess up.But because so many data engineers get by just fine, they think they are qualified to scale. They are not, but their point of view is too limited to notice. They think that data is more important than software, not realising that software design is heavily concerned with matching data structures and algorithms. They think that data is more important than software, denying the need to learn about software design. They think that data is more important than software, ignoring everything that is not data.In short, they are the kind of guys who wonder why things break after they submit thousands of jobs behind NAT, each job using rsync to a single machine having a WAN NFS mount to grid storage. Because they could not be arsed to access it using a standard protocol. And their local test of 10 worked just fine.Are data becoming more valuable than a software?No. Data is becoming software.",

But I feel like time management becomes more and more important has responsibilities increase, for married couples, for example, they need to manage time for dates, going out, planning a family and so on. I don\u2019t currently have to worry about that because I have artificially created more time for myself by staying temporally single. So at the moment I am working on my own as an entrepreneur and lives with family, brothers & mum in a family house, so bills are not much of a problem so that makes me free to focus on what I want to build, a state-of-the-art vision system, which I am about to open-source when I finalize all the experiments.I let things happen naturally, if I am not coding then I will be reading/answering answers/questions on Quora, if I am not doing that I start walking around just outside the house brainstorming new ideas and new approaches to a variety of problems especially the stuff I am working on, sometimes I even do that before sitting down to write an answer to a question.If I am completely free I play video games just to relax. It is important to have a relaxed mindset especially if you are attempting a chance at entrepreneurship.I want to build a vision system which can be applicable in many industrial/domestic applications and wrap a business around those APIs. What I am open-sourcing is the current code base I have been writing and improving on since my undergraduate time, back in 2009, while pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in Electronics engineering. I have noticed that to succeed or to better manage my time I need to collaborate with the best, to do that I need to prove myself, so starting with open-sourcing that is how I want to prove my problem solving skills then approach other experts for collaborations because the projects I have in mind I can\u2019t do them on my own. I need a team or team up with an existing team to tackle the complex project. So it is a change in strategy which is partly going to save some time as well.So I am currently busy working on finishing up a machine learning (ML) personal project and preparing to open-source the code to the public. I normally don\u2019t get into programming competitions but I am going to give it a shot this year and try out Kaggle competitions for a change. I am particularly interested in computer vision related problems.I also don\u2019t drink alcohol, I don\u2019t smoke, I have very few friends (real friends are rare any ways). It is a waste of time and will power spending time with fake friends.Hope this helps.",

For example, my first computer had 3892 bytes of memory with Basic as the standard programming language and the operating system was in ROM. 3892 bytes was not a lot, so the major things I did was part of Finite Element Method computations, some arcade games (car racing in Basic) and a registry for keeping track of dog breeding.With assembly or using Forth, 3892 bytes suddenly was rather \u201clarge\u201d compared to using Basic. So I built digger and similar games in assembly language and scientific/engineering computations in Forth. I did these during my high school period.A lot depends on what peripheral hardware that is connected to the processor. On commodore VIC64 graphics was much simpler compared to commodore VIC20.Added March 27, 2017: I forgot, back in the 2000 there are sources reporting that 99% of the processors are found in embedded computers found everywhere.

"Answer": "I think I am in a unique position to answer this question. I am an Electrical Engineer and I work for a grid automation company. Basically, my company made a software product which helps in making grid efficient.Today, the trend is moving towards automating everything. Whether it be controlling a transformer or operating a pump in a refinery. And for automation, you need to write a piece of code. Thus the focus on coders. What people outside the industry don\u2019t see is that coders, either have to be taught the logic or they have to understand it on their own to write the software. Meaning, if I want to automate operation of a voltage regulator and I am a coder or Software Engineer then I will know how to code but I won\u2019t know the Electrical Engineering principles behind operation of a voltage regulator. Thus, in order to write the software either I will have to learn the EE concepts on my own(think google) or I will need someone to teach me or tell me the logic.This is where an Electrical Engineer who knows coding is useful. The EE graduate will know the EE concepts and knowledge/experience of coding will help him transform that concept to a software that automates the operation. Thus making it efficient. Same for a Mechanical Engineer who knows coding. In my experience, its better to be an EE graduate than a CS graduate. Since, coding languages can be learnt online for free but the EE in depth concepts are difficult to learn online. Also, in today\u2019e education system, no matter what branch of engineer one pursues, coding is involved in one way or the other. Similarly, as a professional, no matter what type of an engineering job you do if you know coding then it will always benefit you and will give you an edge over your competitors.I would suggest you to do EE if you are interested in it but at the same time learn how to code.

"Answer": "If you have an interest in electronics, by all means get a EE degree. It will put you in an excellent position to work on embedded systems, including robotics, drones, and autonomous vehicles. I ended up getting degrees in both (BSEE, MSCS), and have been working with embedded systems ever since microprocessors first came on the scene.But it\u2019s much easier for a EE to learn C programming on their own, than a CS major to try to learn electronic design \u2014 at least that\u2019s been my experience working with other engineers over they years. At the very least, firmware engineers with just a CS degree need to be able to read schematics, use tools like a multimeter, oscilloscope, and logic analyzer. But they won\u2019t be able to tinker with the circuits, make changes or design new ones.My main mistake, many years ago when I got my EE, was to concentrate too much on digital design, and not pay enough attention to analog and RF. My thinking back then was I was never going to been involved in radio. Now everything is wireless! Best to get as broad education an education as you can.",

"Answer": "Ok, C# dev here. Lots of opportunities, mainly in big companies though. Not much of the start up shit, it\u2019s way more corporate : usually you get more pay than for a PHP / JS language. Besides there is a lot of support on it : it\u2019s highly maintained. I\u2019ve found the tools extensive and intuitive. Visual Studio is really a beast, it makes projects quite easy to develop. With C# comes the whoie .NET framework, of course (in web at least) : you\u2019re looking at WebAPI for your REST API, already designed for you. All in all it\u2019s really comprehensive and as it\u2019s used in a lot of big companies who have practically no notion of moving away from a technology (looking at you, banks), you can be pretty sure it\u2019s gonna be around for a while. So, better pay, usually not in start ups so more on time, lot of support on the technology, cool tools \u2026 Ho and the garbage collection is neat, it comes with IIS which is way easier to configure than Apache, and last but not least you won\u2019t find any of the PHP perls and randomness. The language is well built and comprehensive. Only issue : most of it comes at a cost, and even that is going down, with Visual Studio community being free for instance. I do that for a living, it\u2019s not bad. I might say good, even. The one down point, relative to PHP, being that it\u2019s a bit longer to start a project (whereas in PHP you can create a single index.php page, in C# .NET you have to create and host a kind of project, but when you get the hang of it it\u2019s quite easy). There you go. Ho and it\u2019s possible to use it with Angular JS in front end, of course, or any other MVC / MVVM JS framework. I\u2019d recommend it. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easier though. A bit harder than PHP or Ruby.",

They were helped, or hindered, by existing testing corpi (the TREC benchmark (Page Rank does nothing for TREC, so if you are trying to make money: know what to ignore)).So the answer to the question depends if you are the technical developer. <Tough problem.> The past literature to this question is decades old.Or if you are the funder representative, as I was, and be like Stanford (the name for whom their (Larry and Sergey\u2019s) school who basically sold the shovels to gold miners who did the work).

"Answer": "It depends on the CS major at the University. Usually the math requirements are to help build a strong foundation for logical/critical thinking, but advanced math is needed in some computer science classes especially for models and computer vision. Most classes I took (Data structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, etc) did not directly require the use of calculus, but did involve matrices. I did take other classes which were required for my major like advanced statistics which did involve calculus and other advanced mathematics. I felt that I did not need some of the advanced math for CS, but I probably indirectly drew on the concepts learned to write more efficient algorithms/solutions.You don\u2019t need to be a CS major, or have a CS degree to be an app developer. To write an app requires you to learn the languages required and how to apply them to your idea, which you can probably learn on your own. Being a CS major will teach you how to write the app more efficiently, better understand the architecture/concept and how to make it more scalable.But to answer your question, I thought more often the CS classes were more difficult than the math classes, except differential equations, I hated differential equations.",

"Answer": "My understanding of mathematics is pretty dismal. Integral and differential calculus were not a part our CS curriculum, nor would they be crucial to app development (assuming your apps don't require calculus calculations). Linear algebra is more important, given that polynomial functions are important for understanding algorithms.Ultimately I feel that mathematics, mainly discrete mathematics, are vital to the CS major. However, you do not need to be a CS major to be a successful app developer. Being a CS major might just give you more coding finesse and reduce the learning curves for any significant hurdles you encounter during app development.",

"Answer": "I\u2019m waxing nostalgic now.Back when the mouse first appeared for me (and that\u2019s in the 1970s \u2014 because I was in publishing), both \u201cmouses\u201d and \u201cmice\u201d were equally correct plurals for the computer mouse.The original reason for \u201cmouses\u201d was that it\u2019s about computer mouse and therefore it\u2019s a regular noun with a regular plural. It\u2019s not talking about rodents, in which case mouse is an irregular noun with an irregular plural. It was a bid to reduce ambiguity between two different matters.Since the mid-1980s, most publications have settled on \u201cmice\u201d as the predominant plural \u2014 but there is no official plural.Update:\u2014For those who have grilled me on why it\u2019s a regular noun in one but irregular in another:\u2014It\u2019s because the computer mouse isn\u2019t an actual rodent.The plural is regularised because \u2018computer mouse\u2019 was new terminology, and new nouns in modern English are treated as regular nouns for the sake of efficiency and \u2026 you guessed it \u2026 regularity. That\u2019s why the irregular plural wasn\u2019t initially used because it only applied to the actual rodent.",

In fact, if you had 10000 clear frontal face images labelled with height and weight, you could train a classifier that would give you as good a guess as a human.

There is no substitute to it. Though it is hard at first but you have to do it anyway. Yeah , just do, do and do.And once doing become habit you would find yourself interested in making impacts. You can learn one library ,do things on it and play with it until it become your habit.Learn and understand programming fundamentalsThe better you understand them, the easier it is to learn more advanced concepts so always focus on understanding the basics and syntax of programming that will help you to learn advanced topicsAsk for helpTry to find mentors, study buddies, and new friends, regardless of your current skill level. They can help you when you get stuck and make learning easy and funCode in paperCoding-by-hand requires further caution, precision, and intent behind every line of code so it sharpens your proficiency.Read and Understand other\u2019s codeTry to read, understand, run and interpret other\u2019s code so that you can get idea on how it works.You can learn programming yourself from the internet materials but it takes too long time. From my own experience I found it too boring learning without expert help because without proper guidelines and support it gonna take long time to learn the same thing which can be learnt easily in short period. It is not a bad thing at all, but it will be hard to reach top companies like Dropbox, Apple, Docker, Google\u2026To be a great software engineer, you will need 3 skills:At Holberton School of Software Engineering in San Francisco , we provide all these ways to boost up the programming of students. We don\u2019t focus students to learn a selected programing language or a selected framework but help them to solve problems in order that they will achieve success throughout their entire career.Holberton School focuses on:At this programming school, everything is project oriented which follows project-based learning and peer learning in-order to train the best software engineers of their generation. It offers a 2-year different to varsity, coaching full-stack software system engineers. With the progressive approach that Holberton takes, there are not any formal academics and everything is learnt by building and collaborating with peers. The main focus is given to continuous learning and motivation.Check out more about Holberton at Holberton School of Software Engineering in San Francisco .I hope it helps!",

You will learn many languages, but your learning language needs to focus on showing you what you need.Pick problems you want solved, because you'll stick with those.Avoid bootcamps, they tend to have a poor reputation when it comes to programming well.Structured programming follows the simple rule that any difficult problem can be broken up into easier problems, and so on, until you reach problems you have no problem solving.Document like crazy, because you will forget why you have certain parameters in procedures, why variables are declared certain ways and why you've done things the way you have.Where you know what a piece of code must do, write the tests first and then fix the program until the tests are met. It's a much easier way to work, once you're in the rhythm.Code should be as generic as possible, things that the code use should be as constrained as possible. That way, you can reuse code you already have and know that the code won't do weird stuff when you do so.",

But we could invent ways to alter the way we communicate. For instance, movies, photographs, virtual reality, augmented reality, hypertext, social media \u2014 are all new media which impact language use.Even now, there are fairly decent machine translation programs. Imagine that eventually languages could be designed for each individual. A computer could help translate among languages that were all specially designed for each person given their desires, talents, knowledge, tasks, etc.You might like these speculations about AI as well.http://tinyurl.com/hz6dg2d",

If a 1st degree relative has sustained a fragility fracture, especially hip or vertebral body fracture, or multiple fragility fractures, your level of anxiety and concern for your own future may be heightened.....and hopefully you'll see a physician well versed in this field. Not all physicians in the following specialties are interested in osteoporosis, or know how to approach it, but this is where I'd look: rheumatologist, endocrinologist, Ob-GYN (if you're female).....possibly a nephrologist or orthopedic surgeon.

I think if you have some problem with that kind of exercises then you\u2019ll have to study more and better, overall if you don\u2019t understand the first and second requests/answers.However:a) the best case is when the method performs less loops possible. In that case it\u2019s when 1 is returned because it makes only 10 loops.b) same reasoning of point a): the worst case is when the more possible loops are executed so when -1 is returned for a total of 45 loops.c) here some of probability background helps. Due to the equilikely hypothesis you have to calculate a simple average.d) in this last point the simple average is not correct because there are different probability for each result so you have to do a sum weighted on probability:-1 with 20 percent probability => 45 loops with 20 percent probability0 with 10 percent probability => 20 loops with 10 percent probability1 with 70 percent probability => 10 loops with 70 percent probabilityin the average case 45*0.2 + 20*0.1 + 10*0.7 loops are performed",

"Answer": "The best case is that the loop terminates in 10 iterations (the case where it returns 1). The worst case is when it terminates in 45 iterations (the case when it returns -1). The average case is found by adding each of the three possible iteration values (number of loops for 1, 0, and -1), and then average them together by dividing by 3. The expected case is found by multiplying the number of iterations by the probability of occurrence. This yields 45 * .2 (20% chance of returning -1) + 20 * .1 (10% chance of returning 0) + 10 * .7 (70% chance of returning 1). Summing these together then gives the answer 18.",

People using Python are mostly (in my opinion, which may be wrong) involved in machine learning applications, so they invested their time to bring necessary packages to the system. If they were interested in PK analyses, they woul create appropriate implementations as well.Currently only SAS (an industry standard in this area) and R (SAS\u2019s main competitor in evidence-based medicine) have implemented the most set of methods used in the whole biostatistics. There also specialized programs, like WinNonlin or nQuery, but they are not general purpose statistical packages. Other packages, like Statistica, SPSS, Stata are also well equipped and often used, but the methods coverage is less.So\u2026 as Bob said, at least try to learn R and see if it solves your problem. You lose nothing. R is really the best option in terms of free software.And you know what? You can always take a look at the R packages and reproduce them in Python, make them even better.",

For general purpose sorting, the complexity of comparison-based sorting is \u03a9(nlogn)\u03a9(nlogn)\u03a9(n log n). There are some algorithms that perform sorting in O(n)O(n)O(n), but they all rely on making assumptions about the input, and are not general purpose sorting algorithms.Probably your best bet is to use a quicksort, mergesort, or radix sort, depending on how much data you have, length of the strings, etc. Another option is to build a trie, then do an in-order traversal. That approach can be extremely fast, but could require a lot of memory. Building the the trie is O(n\u2217m)O(n\u2217m)O(n*m) where nnn is the number of strings and mmm is the average length of the strings. For relatively large nnn and small mmm, this can be a big win.

In the general case, with data that may be completely random, a quicksort is the best algorithm. If you know something about the data other algorithms present as better for specific data sets. For example if the range of distinct keys is finite and small a bucket or radix sort will tend to perform very well.If the data is partially ordered some algorithms will outperform quicksort. One of those is an algorithm I published in 1986 that I called UnShuffle. ( Link: http://www.askdbmgt.com/uploads/... ) Its general behavior is O(kN) where k is a constant representing the level of entropy (chaos or randomness) in the data. For low entropy data sets (most real world data sets exhibit low entropy) <k> is a small integer. If the data is already ordered on the sort key UnShuffle exhibits O(N) performance and is comparable to a validation run.",

"Answer": "A2A.Too many things to cover for new consultants, but here\u2019s one based on a post I shared awhile back on my blog regarding consulting and corporate politics. Perhaps I have a parochial view.My take is that consultants should take no part in corporate politics.It was a lesson that I learned early on while at the management consulting firm PRTM.Here\u2019s the rationale for \"no politics.\u201d Consultants are often brought in to make things better. Clients pay a premium for consultants for any number of reasons. One common reason is that consultants are supposed to be unbiased third-parties. If one gets consumed in politics, there\u2019s not enough focus on motivating everyone to get to the end goal.Here\u2019s another distinction as it relates to consulting:Sympathy can lead to a dark side. Suppose one is working within a business unit (sponsored by one of the EVPs) and there are two VPs below the EVP that don\u2019t get along with one another. You are alone in the office with one of the VPs that you may like better from a personal chemistry point of view, and this VP starts to bad mouth the other VP. If you join into this sort of thing, while you may be ingratiating yourself with the one VP, you are hurting the client by participating in politics. Bad mouthing is just not constructive. In this sort of scenario, you should probably consider something like letting the VP know that you can understand why he/she might feel this way but that as a consultant, you can\u2019t have any part in this. Other good options would be to try to get the VPs to work it out face-to-face. One may also want to probe a bit with the VP to see if it is a worthwhile thing to bring things up with the EVP if the disfunctionality is hurting the productivity of the business in a significant way. Junior consultants should probably also consult with their firm\u2019s primary manager for the engagement, especially before escalating things to the client sponsor level.P.S. Related to the subquestion details about confidentiality of client name, this is usually the case as specified in the written agreement between clients and the management consulting firms. That said, I have seen some carve out cases for those consulting firms that do joint venture, special design, business development, or interim management work. I personally have set up a number of these types of arrangements._______________Steve Shu specializes in incubating new initiatives with a primary focus on strategy, technology, and behavioral economics.

We can not judge what is going to happen to an industry just by few small happenings around the world..Protectionism by few countries might hurt our outsourcing industry little, but as Indian IT sector\u2019s clients are spread across the globe, there will be less damage..It is not possible for any developed nation to fully stop outsourcing.. The main reason is the salary paid in India to Software Engineers is far much lesser than what is paid in US.. If US wants all the (Previously) outsourced jobs done by locals than it will not be possible for American companies to pay to locals in US dollars to get all the work done..How can an American company remain profitable by paying 10 times the salary to each employee?? In India I am seeing several Engineers working for as low as INR 30K per month.. Now if his work has to done by an American in America, they should be paid atleast 10 times of it.. How long can American companies survive paying such high salaries??Moreover, the skills that Indian IT people posses, can\u2019t be replaced by locals in developed nations.. Here we train to students to a much higher standard than other countries.. We have millions graduating in IT each year.. I think it will be very difficult to get that much of qualified local people in other countries..Even when Obama administration came to office, they wanted to stop outsourcing.. But what happened?? It is not practically stop outsourcing.. Every country needs the talents at lower cost only then, their economy will grow..",

The recent FED rate hike by the USA makes us to predict that the global economy is improving & hence to control inflation we can see the recent hike in the monetary policy by the worlds greatest economy. Some economist predicts that this hike will effect the investment in emerging markets like India making the investors to park their money in US for higher returns but considering the Global economy doing well we can expect the consumer demand to increase which means automatically the exports will be increasing which was not the case for the past few years so the Indian software exports too will be increasing and we cant expect recession for Indian IT sector.Moreover USA remains to be the higher software export partner for India & they dont have much talented STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) graduates to meet their own domestic clients demands hence the chances of curbing the H1B Visa is also less (not the Premium H1B Visas which it had revoked temporarily). Apart from this we Indians are not substitute for American jobs we are just an add on to them to grow their economy & so we cant say that 2017 will be a recession year for Indian IT industry.",

If you don\u2019t know any of the frameworks involved in mobile development and you have never programmed a videogame, it\u2019ll take a loooong time.Creating a graphical interface is a huge jump from simply coding.Learning all the concepts involved with making even a very simple videogame, from managing all the different states and dealing with events, is pretty complicated.If you can rip through a bunch of tutorials, it\u2019ll help a lot to get your feet wet, but it\u2019s still tough to try to design something yourself and implement it.So, I\u2019m definitely thinking a few months for you to learn the basics well. Maybe a year.Once you have that down you should be able to whip up simple games in a manner of a week or two, but I\u2019m talking flappy-bird and tic-tac-toe simple. Anything more complicated really depends on what goals you have.Of course, you can learn very very quickly and publish a game that\u2019s poorly designed with a lot of bugs and crashes, but to have a really good understanding, try to be patient as you learn.",

"Answer": "So, I recently had an app go up on the Google Play and App Store. Although the application I made was much different than a game, I think I can somewhat answer your question. The app I made was pretty much a web application, so I used the Ionic framework (which is essentially apache cordova and angularJS to make phone apps). You would not want to use a hybrid framework like ionic, phonegap, cordova, etc for a game (unless it was a really simple game). With that being said you now need to learn how to code native android (Java) and native iOS (Swift or Objective-C, I would recommend swift but, to each their own). I would chose which ever seems easier to you first and go from there. Once you had it finished on one I don\u2019t imagine making the next would be as difficult (obviously you\u2019ll have to write it twice but making it once you would have a lot of the details ironed out).And how long the development itself will take is up to you. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re busy with college and whatnot so I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be an instant thing. But with that being said, in college I always wanted to know the answer to stuff like this. I always wanted to make something original and unique but I felt limited because I didn\u2019t think I knew enough at that time. So my advice is if this is something you want to do, just start doing it and don\u2019t think about how long it will take you. If you encounter something you don\u2019t understand, look into it more. Don\u2019t worry too much about the fact it\u2019s going to go on app stores while you\u2019re developing it, there are things you may need to change when you send it to the app stores but that should have no serious bearing on your development of the app. In college I was paralyzed by indecision of what to do, what I should be learning, can I learn that with how much I know, etc. At the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing to do but to do it.If you\u2019re asking how long it takes for apps to get on google play or the app store, that\u2019s the easy-ish part. That\u2019s just packaging up some applications and googling what you need to do. Apple takes some time to approve apps and they may ask you questions about your application and whatnot but I did not find the process particularly cumbersome.Best of luck with your game and college.",

In that sense there is no new story here.If I own a company that builds houses, and doing the work myself yields a certain output, then I have a variety of ways to increase my total output:AI is just another way for me to increase my output. It might augment the existing means. Or it might replace an investment in other tools, an investment in education or an investment in labor. The particulars of where it fits in and what, if anything, it replaces, would depend on the particular cost/benefit profile.The effect on labor, which I suspect you are trying to get at, will also depend on the particulars. If I just have dull saws then I might need more workers, because sawing wood is slower. If I invest in sharper saws I could use fewer workers to do the same amount of work, or I might use the same amount of workers to do more work. Which one I do depends on market conditions, how much more a sharper saw costs me, and what the demand is for more houses. If the demand is high, then I might keep all my workers. If demand is low then I might not. At the same time I\u2019m probably helping the sharper saw maker\u2019s business grow, and he might be hiring more workers to keep up with his increased demand.AI is not really all that different from the perspective of the capitalist.

Theoretical CS is for those who could have been pure mathematicians but are more interested in the theories of CS than the theories of pure mathematics.So how advanced is math in theoretical CS? Extremely advanced, and beyond what many people can understand if they\u2019re not theoreticians to begin with. Moreover, theoretical computer scientists do an enormous amount of proofs in their work. So in a way I feel they\u2019re closer to pure mathematicians than even theoretical physicists are.

"Answer": "AI has gone through several periods in its evolution. From 1960 to about 2000 the emphasis was mostly on manipulation of symbols and concepts using logic methods. Since 2000 the emphasis has shifted to more numerical, probabilistic, and learning-driven, all of which rely heavily on numbers and mathematical techniques to manipulate them (event calculus, linear algebra, regression, correlation, feedback, etc). From the outset, methods and concepts in economics has also factored heavily in AI, especially using game theory, decision theory, models of price and cost and optimization, and adversarial planning.In short, without math (and logic (and economics)), there is no AI.",

"Answer": "TPR (True Positive Rate)(sensitivity) and TNR(True Negative Rate)(specificity)Sensitivity and specificity are two measures used together in some domains to measure the predictive performance of a classification model or a diagnostic test. For example, to measure the effectiveness of a diagnostic test in the medical domain, sensitivity measures the fraction of people with disease (i.e., positive examples) who have a positive test result; and specificity measures the fraction of people without disease (i.e., negative examples) who have a negative test result. They are defined with reference to a special case of the confusion matrix, with two classes, one designated the positive class, and the other the negative class",

"Answer": "Most of the really interesting problems with faSDVs (How do we make them handle human-directed traffic? Car washes? Parking on the lawn? Gravel driveways? Dirt roads? Pulling into garages?) will remain unsolved for the foreseeable future, so my guess is that there will be plenty to work on.To be honest, I\u2019d be more worried about carmakers realizing that they can easily get to, say, level 3, but that level 5 will require so much research with such long horizons that shareholders will get fed up with funding it, and the hype (and jobs) will gradually drain away over the next ten years, kinda like the previous bubbles around turbine power, flying cars, and airships. But then again it might not. It\u2019s hard to tell.On the bright side, it\u2019s not like having training in CS with a focus on ML will leave you abandoned at the side of the road; those skills will be relevant in plenty of other fields even if SDVs drain into the proverbial sewer of failed-innovation despair. What I don\u2019t know is whether having a masters as opposed to a bachelors or a phd will be a help or a hindrance; I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s an uncomfortable valley of qualification for holders of masters degrees, but as a dropout entrepreneur myself I am just about the last person to ask for advice on that count!",

"Answer": "One example, if I correctly follow your question, is in the recent movie \u201cHidden Figures\u201d. \u201cHidden figures\u201d is a movie about three African American women that were key to putting a man into space and on the moon. They were \u201ccomputers\u201d as was the word used for people with an excellence of mathematics or employed as such, before the term became regularly used for the machines that do the same. It is said that John Glenn had such a trust for the team of three woman particulary Johnson, that he wouldnt put his life at risk without \u201cher\u201d checking the calculations of the computer that had seemed to have err\u2019d. John glenn , the first man to orbit earth, wanted this woman to check the calculations of an IBM computer. There are historical refrences to folks wih an high aptitude in math, but this is a recent movie that points out a few.I think that Steve Wozniak just makes the cut because his aptitude helped drive the PC on its course. Computers were not yet established in society, his genius and aptitude was allowed to express itself in designing the personal \u201ccomputer-tool\u201d that would allow others to take the \u201ccomputer-tool\u201d to futher express themselves.

Tell yourself... for how long have you been feeling this way.Remember the time when you used not to think this way? What's the difference now?Then you didn't have a so-called serious life. You didn't have a university life.You probably didn't feel the exam pressure so hard.You probably didn't had the 100% of responsibility for your future.Now, stop looking at the end of the fucking tunnel for god's sake. There is no tunnel. It is a maze where you choose paths with an unknown probability of success in whatever the course you want to engage in.That's life. Deal with it.Major exams are supposed to test your knowledge in whatever the fuck you have learned in the particular insitute. They are not.... I repeat. THEY ARE NOT supposed to make you feel suicidal (wondering what is the point of living, according to the description is kinda suicidal. Keep reading please). You're getting the wrong result out of the exam.Right result: I still have room for improvent. So I want to be better at it. I learned that my ability to perform in this exam is lower than the level the norm has expected.Or.This is enough. I'm going to do something better which will benefit me.If you're still thinking about the point of your life, I can show you the point of life.It is: Going through YOUR LIFE, on YOUR TERMS, with a PLAN, heading some UNKNOWN DESTINATION.But, since everybody has to deal with the uncertainty we take it out of the equation as a common factor to simplify the algebra...So we live life as there is no probability of faliure. To be exact, there is no actual faliure. You didn't fail in the exam. You received an \"F\"(or a lower grade). You only learned that you had to improve your educational skills.Blaming the circumstances only makes you more negative. Because the reason and the effect is so well balanced that your mind beleives it with no denying. Financially talking nobody is neither born poor nor rich. You develop your financial status.Money is a tool. Not a circumstance nor a reason to feel down.Physical inabilities... I can't tell you that I'm familliar with walking inabilities but I can understand that it is painful.Exercise. Maintain your health. Make it happen.You can walk a block. After passing a block, there is a another block. You said you can pass a block. Then pass the next one too.It will be hard but it will be with it. Focus on the \"worth it\" rather than \"hard\".The point is: Start new. Start genuinely.Right now, ladies and gentlemen, life has given us sour lemons.Let's add some sugar and make some sweet lemonade.Create luck!",

I lived in an impoverished region of my country known as the Cape Flats. I was suffering from a disability like you, although mine was of the mental variety. In short, I was kind of going through something akin to what you speak of.Since then nothing much has changed, actually. I still live in the Cape Flats and I still suffer with my OCD. I did happen to scrape through my degree by the skin of my teeth. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that life has become more enjoyable and manageable since then, even though I\u2019m still going through some of the same problems. I feel older and more equipped to deal with things even though some days don\u2019t feel that way. In the last few years I\u2019ve also picked up a few hobbies which bring me joy. I started playing chess, writing more and flipping butterfly knives.

"Answer": "There is no should.There is \u2018can win.\u2019You can win by using this.Much accredited, peer-reviewed research has shown that lives are run by emotions, with a surface of cognition. As we get past twenty, the reconnections of the brain, and the stresses of formal education, are waning, and we have more time to think about personal significance. We also begin to think about the limited time we have to make a difference, and our mortality.That\u2019s when the incomplete, and often contradictory, inputs that formed our base in early years become more powerful. The puzzlement, anger, joys, frustrations, of childhood became habits. Those habits got dragged along into adulthood, and concealed by the needs of growing up.I have done Landmark, and other programs. I have read widely in philosophies, religions, and noted common elements in different guises. The common elements of philosophies, religions, guidances can be stripped of their guesses, fears, and circumstances. When that is done, the essential human nature recognizes common truth.That was all done long ago in India, China, Korea, Japan, and made available. Even though the clarified essence of life is available, most people still prefer the obscuring comfort of old habits.If you truly want to transcend the limitations of emotional frustration, please take a look at this.Living is a combination of adapting the world, and adapting to the world.Since every action, and thought is an action, it affects every other reality.Since every action creates reactions, whether they are obvious, or not, there is no clear delineation of cause, and effect. That means your perspective is both internal, and external.Make your perspective consistent with the essential relationships of life, and your life will be full of well-met challenges, and exploitation of opportunities.The path to doing that is the subject of most human efforts beyond rote actions. The rote actions like feeding, fighting, fleeing, fornicating are so ingrained, they are taken as the entire purpose of life. Even the self-aggrandizements, and adornments are little more than bower-bird activities. You can escape that trap, and out-compete almost all humans by using the relationships of events, rather than just focusing on rote, and separate events.Here\u2019s how to focus on the essential relationships, and become a champion of life.2. Bedrock of RealityThe bedrock of reality is a set of simple to explain, yet difficult to accept realities.They are simple because that is the nature of fundamentals.They are hard to accept because they bypass, and challenge, so many assumptions to which we are habituated.This is a starter descriptionThe words in bold, are the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese words describing the essential relationships of life.Life is better when you pay attention. Don\u2019t get lost in a fog of distractions. This is summarized in the word Nam.Reality is both visible, and obvious, or potential, and obscure.These are some examples.You are unique-ho, and so is every other being -myo. You are an aspect \u2013ho, of everything, and so are we all -myo. There is what is known directly -ho, and what is not known, or only suspected -myo. The inseparability is summarized in the conjunction of the two words - Myoho.Causes produce effects, for all of us. Sometimes the effects are not immediately obvious. This is symbolized by the lotus -ren blossom \u2013ge. The lotus blossom, cause, also contains the seed pod - effect. The simultaneous occurrence of cause, and effect is summarized in the conjunction of the two words -Renge.Lives change, Yet, Life goes on. This is symbolized by the warp, and woof of cloth. The changing of events is the cross fibers, or woof. The continuity, persistence, is symbolized by warp -KyoThose who keep these simple realities in mind, simultaneously, will have fewer accidents, and be able to develop better lives.These consistently real truths are intuitively obvious, yet we often forget one, or more, when we react. Our emotional past, and the inherited tendencies from our ancestors, sometimes get in the way of currently practical, rational thought.We can protect our good sense when we make efforts to infuse these fundamentals into our lives. The infusion happens when we speak the words repeatedly.They are spoken, in an even tone, and rhythm, to engage neuroplasticity.https://controlsyou.quora.com/Wins",

"Answer": "Poverty, physical disability, failure in exam...they all sounds quite manageable and not at all good enough reasons to end your life. You are not able to see the light or the tunnel has become so long because you have stopped walking. You cannot see the light because of the blinds of failure and negativity you are wearing. Once you take off these blinds, you will be able to see that there is an end to the tunnel and you can reach it quite easily.You just have to keep walking!Failure in examI have worked as a head hunter and honestly, nobody and i mean NOBODY is bothered about your degrees or exams you passed or failed or how much you scored. While recruiting an employee, most of the companies look for your skills and knowledge. Qualification is just a criteria to shortlist people which is also NOT applicable everywhere. So thinking of ending life because of failing an exam is not worth my friend.PovertyPoverty is more to do with how you see it! Believe me, money can get you everything but happiness. It is your attitude which keeps you pumped up and happy. However, you will improve financially once you get a job. I come from a lower middle class family and I have seen my parents fight over little issues because of our not-so-good financial status. We have seen time where we used to get just the money to commute to college and get back and not even a single extra buck. But we (me and my brother) dreamed and now we are doing much better in terms of earnings.Physical disabilityThere are so many people who inspite of being physically disabled excelled in sports and few of them became great athletes. We should respect the life we have and make the best out of what has been given to us.It takes courage to accept your failure and share it with others. It takes courage to follow your dreams :)Always remember \u201cLife rewards Courage\u201d!",

In practice we do not care about the original matrix, the purpose is that you are approximating that matrix as it low rank. We can form a new one and use this for least squares minimization.

Some people think they are less bad at it than average, that\u2019s about as good as anyone with any awareness at all will claim.The cost of hiring a bad engineer is immense. The cost of passing on a good hire is almost always lower. For this reason, much like our legal system is designed to let 100 guilty people go free before it convicts a single innocent person, the coding interview process will prefer to reject good candidates rather than risk hiring a bad one. That means it *intentionally* rejects some good candidates.The process most companies use is particularly unforgiving for people who are not confident, for people who rely upon many tools or google searches, for people who get nervous easily, and for people who \u201cdon\u2019t look like a programmer\u201d (i.e. women and minorities).

I know this is a tough role where you have not only to understand the technical skills of your potential collaborator but also to evaluate how his sometimes unorthodox opinions depend on his experience rather than his lack of knowledge. And, most important of all, how his skills will integrate in the existing team.Then, due to one of the strange life situations, I had to quit my company and quit my country: from the owner of my company I became an employee of a corporate and, of course, I was \u201ctested\u201d by many interviewers. Change of roles.Among many things I can do, I have always developed software and I looked for a job in that area. Albeit a bit strange, I have developed software to interface dozens of measurements instruments, firmware for motion control, data analysis, CAD software for printed circuit boards, database applications, websites, CPU simulators and many more things.Despite my experience, I had a bad time with a number of technical interviews. Most of the interviewers had less technical experience than me, probably were unable to solve many problems I was able to, nevertheless they were totally convinced that programming is the (rather mechanical) application of some principles, be those of OOP, of functional programming or the topic they studied in the last years of university.After some struggle, I managed to get a job but the more I see what people develop, the more I understand that the poor quality of the code, the poor quality or total of lack of the documentation, the idiot use of some principles to release useless and incomprehensible artifacts, like most of the UML charts I have seen, is a logical outcome of this process.I got s job once I made up my mind and I accepted to develop, as external developer, a full application. A couple of months after the release of this application I had a proposal of a full time job: no technical interview, my skills were already tested on the road.In My Humble Opinion, the average technical selection process is largely medieval and prone to select people that are able to talk about technical problems rather than professionals that these problems are able to solve.",

However in artificial intelligence a machine is operated in a way to imitate human intelligence. Meaning that a machine copies information in the mind of a human.Difference: Data science deals with automatic gathering of knowledge. They are programmed like regular machines.

"Answer": "Yes. Each finite language is decidable, hence each undecidable language must be infinite. And in an infinite language there have to be arbitrarily long words. More precisely, for each nnn there must be a word w\u2208w\u2208w\\inL1L1L_1 such that |w|\u2265n|w|\u2265n|w|\\geq n. If this weren\u2019t the case, L1L1L_1 would be finite, as there are only finitely many words of length less than nnn. Hence, L2=\u2115L2=NL_2=\\mathbb{N} and that is trivially decidable.",

"Answer": "Sometimes the code generated by a compiler may have some redundant operations; for example, it may load into a register a value from memory several times, when it only needs to do it once.

"Answer": "Well, yes it is possible! This is the idea behind managed languages. In C++ you have to create your ways around.For example Intel has a very clever bitscanning assembly function, but this function is not available on all CPUs. Therefore, you instruct your compiler with macros statements to include this function call when ever possible.#IfDef INTEL_Hint bscanf(int num){ return bsfscan(num); }#elseint bscanf(int num){slow way of doing it with loops}#endIf you are talking about something differently. Then I would like to point to managed languages. The entire point of these frameworks is to make life easier for the programmer and at the same time execute the code in the most efficent way for the particular platform.Update:With the C++ example I meant that you have to compile this in advance for a specific platform.",

"Answer": "It\u2019s called \u201cinstruction level optimisation\u201d - and that\u2019s often a part of what a modern compiler tries to do. So, most compilers would spot if I said:a = b * 2 ;\u2026and change it to:a = b + b ;\u2026because addition is typically faster than multiplication - and the answer is the same.If you say:a = b ;c = a ;\u2026and then never use \u2018a\u2019 again - then it\u2019ll just go a head and generate code for:c = b ;\u2026and \u2018a\u2019 will never exist.But this is just scratching the surface. The compilers for fancy CPU\u2019s like the x86 family will know things like that the \u201cinteger math unit\u201d and the \u201cfloating point math unit\u201d can operate in parallel. So if I write:a = b * 123.456 + d * 876.543 ;c = x + 17 ;\u2026it might change this to:a = b * 123.456 ;c = x + 17 ;a += d * 876.543 ;\u2026because it knows that while \u201cb * 123.456\u201d is being calculated - the integer processor doesn\u2019t have any work to do - so by doing the integer calculation of \u201cx + 17\u201d BEFORE the \u201cd * 876.543\u201d calculation is started, the time needed to do the integer math overlaps the time for some of the floating point code\u2026which makes that calculation be (in effect) \u201cfree\u201d.There is MUCH more to it than this though.Instruction level optimization is a MASSIVE subject\u2026most programmers (mercifully) never have to know a thing about it though! We\u2019ve come to trust that the compiler can generate better code than 99% of humans - so we let it do it\u2019s thing and think very little about what it might be doing to our code.",

"Answer": "Yes. For the statement given, the proof is trivial, to the point that it makes me wonder if you actually had something slightly different in mind.Every DFA is a degenerate NFA. Ergo, any language accepted by a DFA can also be accepted by an identical NFA. If there are multiple accepting states, you can add eta-transitions to the NFA from each original accepting state to a single common accepting state. Thus you have an NFA with a single marked state that accepts the same language as the original DFA by construction. In the case where the original DFA only had a single accepting state, adding extra transitions is unnecessary, and the resulting NFA remains identical to the original DFA.",

"Answer": "Well, I have to admit that smart phones are quite amazing devices (eventhough I don\u2019t own one). As an invention that has roughly started 10 years ago, we can expect that we will be \u201cstuck\u201d with the smart phone for quite a while until someting completely new comes to the table.But what can be done?We can make improvements in the field of durability and power supply. Creating smart phones that can charge themselves using solar panels or whatever other technology available in the future.Or we can make improvement in the field of usability. Flexible, super thin screens you can take with you as a piece of paper for example.But let\u2019s be honest here. These are improvements, not leaps forward.So what do I think will be the next leap forward in smart phones?Since the start of computer technology, the real and virtual always have been devided. You were busy in one or the other. And I believe the next leap forward will break this boundry and combine the virtual world with the real one.You heard that right. Augmented Reality.Various attempts have been made over the last few years. One well known for example is a VR (Virtual Reality) glasses. In my opinion VR is cool for video games and such, but it simply isn\u2019t practical to use in public.The closest device to establish AR is the Microsoft Hololens. It is capable of projecting virtual objects and menu\u2019s in the real world.Sadly enough the Microsoft Hololens is very limited and didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. I think AR has tons of potential for business, economics, creation, creativity and many other things. AR will blend the amazing world of technology with our everyday activities.That\u2019s our next leap forward.Thanks for the A2A!",

"Answer": "For over a decade, I\u2019ve been saying that smartphones will, starting in about 2015, begin to evolve into true assistants. I would call this the AI Butler, or I-Butler.The Google Assistant was a first attempt at this. It certainly won\u2019t be the last.As speech recognition becomes nearly perfected (there will still be issues with infections such as colds, background noise and so forth, but less and less over time), one will converse naturally with the I-Butler. It will learn to anticipate your needs, ever evolving its involvement in your life according to:For most of us, as \u201canticipatory activities\u201d of the I-Butler (i.e. thinking about things that matter in your life with the same values and considerations as you would think about them, though of course not via the same thinking process) increase in range and sophistication, I expect some software companies (NOT small app developers, but big AI leaders, which interface massive databases with you via an app) to begin offering this in very limited areas, such as \u201cautomatic sorting, answering, and filing of emails\u201d.Even then, to avoid serious mistakes and user outrage, I expect these initial offerings to come with significant caveats and very strong encouragement that the user monitor every such decision by the AI for an extended \u201ctraining period\u201d.Still, some won\u2019t do that, or will do it in a cavalier fashion, which will lead to well-publicized (often hilarious, and sometimes tragic) mistakes.I-Butlers will book appointments for us, placing them on calendars and reminding us of what we need to do to prepare for those appointments. They will help us prepare for meetings, looking at the topic and helping to prepare agendas. They will keep track of the people with whom we interact, reminding us of particular considerations such as their styles of communication and personal issues.Over time, and not as much time as one might think, it will gain the ability to converse with people in your voice. (The voice synthesis, including inflections, is already possible. The intelligence of response is what awaits further development.)By the late 2020s, fewer and fewer people will be able to tell whether they\u2019re talking to you on the \u201cphone\u201d, or to your I-Butler. I expect this development to emerge amidst controversy, and would not be at all surprised to see a law passed requiring the AI to announce: \u201cYou are conversing with Jonathan\u2019s I-Butler.\u201d Its application will be constrained by social norms as well as users\u2019 comfort level for many years to come. For a long time, I expect the I-Butler to have a setting \u201cPress Zero at any time to cease talking to me and leave a message\u201d, with an urgency setting, so that real people don\u2019t become annoyed.)Eventually, these will talk to each other, though probably they\u2019ll use texting for faster throughput.As ever increasing parts of our lives and the electronic equivalent of our thought processes begin to be outsourced to computers, huge companies, and the cloud, there will be major sociological and\u2014likely\u2014legal implications. (I would expect Google to offer a paid version of I-Butler that sharply restricts its access to the files, but I could be wrong.)We\u2019re entering fascinating times.",

Since David Deutsch is largely a singular figure in terms of his views on science, it is best to approach this answer while taking his views into account.My impression of constructor theory is that it is much more of an epistemological theory of physics than an ontological reductionist theory. If you are familiar with Deutsch\u2019s work (especially the influence of Karl Popper\u2019s philosophy of science on his work), this should come as no surprise. To him, epistemology is more fundamental than reductionism. Science, in his eyes, is about giving good explanations, rather than reducing observable phenomena in the sciences (psychology, biology, chemistry, etc.) to their most fundamental nature (physics).I think constructor theory is a nice epistemological formulation of the higher-level sciences, but I think it\u2019s a misnomer to classify it as a physical theory, i.e. a theory whose objective is to explain the foundational ontology of the physical world, i.e. natural laws, ontology of space and time, etc. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really even a good explanatory theory of physics; contemporary formalisms utilizing algebra, geometry, and (especially) computational structures such as cellular automata seem much more intuitive than abstract causal constructors do.So while constructor theory serves as a nice, widely-applicable formalism for the higher-level sciences, and is certainly a better explanatory theory than reductionism, (though reductionism is more of an ontological theory), it seems to be lag behind contemporary physical theories in terms of fundamental ontological explanations.We might characterize constructor theory as a fundamental high-level epistemological theory, but not a fundamental low-level ontological theory. I don\u2019t see it replacing fundamental physics, but I do see a bright future for its use in sciences with relatively high complexity, such as biology and psychology.",

"Answer": "I'm only qualified to comment on the sections that touch on the theory of computation, and I only skimmed them.I didn't see any blatant errors, but I also didn't see anything very original. The author objects that the Church-Turing thesis cannot be proven, and that it depends on the laws of physics. But computer scientists already are aware of these facts.I would be interested if the author could provide laws of physics that allow for some model more powerful than a Turing machine. I'm not aware of any (note that quantum computers can be simulated by Turing machines). But I didn't see any such proposal here.The author believes that his idea of constructors can unite theoretical physics and the theory of computation into one theory.But his paper is too informal to be a meaningful contribution to the theory of computation. I want to see at least a couple formal definitions and a theorem or two. We have mathematical definitions of Turing machines; but what is his mathematical definition of a constructor? After reading the paper, I still don't know.",

"Answer": "Personally, I see it as a step in the the right direction, however it\u2019s still overlooking the hard problem of consciousness, which is really the problem of how physical laws permit qualia (flavors, colors, feelings, etc) to exist. What would constructor theory say about the existence of a spectrum with a fixed number of primary colors? What physical law would permit more colors to appear? What limit would there be?How would Constructor theory predict how many sense modalities there are, and how they can be used to communicate the same information but in a totally different way?To me, the problem with our contemporary concept of \u2018information\u2019 is that the \u2018in-\u2019 is actually overlooked. Constructor theory seems to assume a transcendental phenomenon which is responsible for formation and transformation, but I have not seen that it supports the most important feature of nature to us, which is the qualitative result of direct experience (whether that experience informs us or not).",

"Answer": "Short Answer: OmnipresenceBecause it serves so many purposes in our lives, it would be desired that AI be integrated with everything we use. In this process it will complete its transition from being merely an ADDITION right now to being a Essential PART of our lives, just like electricity has became over the past 100 years..In the beginning, at times of Nikola Tesla and Edison, electricity must have been a luxury entity and usual chatter between people would have been, \u201cSee I have electricity in my home ! Don\u2019t you ?\u201d. It was because having your room lit by a bulb all night, all days of the year was not common back then and electricity was a \u201cWOW\u201d thing. Slowly over the century, as we perfected the transmission lines system, the rhetoric would have changed to \u201cOh, You don\u2019t have electricity in your home ? Where are you from ?\u201d.Its going to be very similar thing in case of AI too. Right now, in our lives we have Siri, Google Now or Amazon Alexa or Cortana. When they came, it was a big deal but slowly systems like these will become totally common in our societies that they will be invisible to us and yet always listening, understanding and assisting us in all means.All in all both electricity and AI will become omnipresent in our lives without us even realizing it. Their presence will be brought to life only in their absence, just like you realize that your Wifi Router runs on electricity, only when the power goes off.",

But in the end what matters is your analytical mind and problem solving skills more than anything else.I am not saying that it doesn\u2019t matter what stream of Engineering you choose, but what I mean to say is that if you do not have an analytical mind, can not bother to apply theory to practice and can not strive or be enthusiastic about picking apart a thing/process to know how it works, then maybe engineering is not for you.When you go for a job, they will look at your marks, problem solving skills, communication skills, presentation skills along with your theoretical knowledge.Hope this was helpful.",

"Answer": "Nothing will replace traditional newspapers. But let's qualify this.Most of their constituent parts have free digital competitors - news, comics, sports, classified ads and so on. Most of them are more efficient, from many points of view, than their newspaper versions. But these competitors are usually stand-alone services.The bundle that are newspapers, though, with the mission of publishing something for everyone and getting a big mass of readers from that varied basket of curiosities, has no exact digital substitute and, it seems, is falling out of favor with readers.Well, social media play the role of bundle, but in a different fashion.Each day, readers can get content more tailored to their preexisting opinion. For them, that is a much more appealing proposition than a newspaper that aims to talk to everyone. Of course, the middle ground gets lost in the trade and that's in part how we got to 2017.Now: so far, no media has really been replaced by a newer one. Newspapers were not replaced by radio, radio was not replaced by TV. What happened is that they all adapted to changing circumstances, finding more of their unique language from their own strengths. Sometimes finding a new market as something niche, premium, like vinyl records did after they were considered dead.So, I think some newspapers will adapt somehow. Mass audiences will not be for them. But some of them may find profitable niches, adapting their content to the new environment where commodity information is cheap but specially crafted information is rare.The costs for producing a newspaper are still huge, though, and the ad-supported model is proving insufficient to cover. Increasingly most of the revenues are paid for by subscriptions. Not all newspapers are strong enough to be appealing for subscriptions in an age where lots can be gotten for free.Of course the big ones, like the NYT, Guardian, WSJ, Financial Times will probably stay for a long time. They have very distinctive strengths and appeal to a wide audience. But they have also transformed in something more analytic than your usual paper from the 90s.Some bet on becoming more magazine-like. Some, like recent British hit The New European, bet on catering to a specific audience (the Brits who were against Brexit) and have success on their own terms.What is dead is the something-for-everyone model. But there might be a vinyl-like future.",

"Answer": "Mesh networks are formed when end hosts directly connect with one another and relay traffic for one another.They are useful when connectivity is very, very sparse. They are not very good at providing high bandwidth. They are poor at providing Internet access because the nodes that are providing the uplink typically congest.Mesh networks cannot provide a substitute for the Internet backbone. The bandwidth simply isn\u2019t there, by many many orders of magnitude.Mesh networks are pointless as a weapon for net neutrality because every mesh network must have a meaningful uplink. And that\u2019s still going to come from some ISP somewhere.The Internet of Things is a marketing ploy to sell systems that have no meaningful need for Internet connectivity. While Internet of Things nodes may use or form a Mesh network, it\u2019s far more likely that they will just use conventional Wi-Fi.",

"Answer": "No. Mesh networks are a cool concept. The idea is that everybody talks to their neighbour and the system find a path by hopping from node to node to it\u2019s destination. On a small scale they can be great and offer robustness without central control.But they are very hard to scale up even when all the nodes are owned and managed by one entity. If you try and make a mesh from consumer owned nodes it can become very fragile and bottlenecks are a constant problem.There are working examples of dedicated mesh networks. MonkeyBrains (a San Francisco ISP) runs one. However they put a lot of work into node locations, network design and redundant links.At the scale of the overall internet mesh is completely impractical. Big ISP\u2019s are using multiple 100 gigabit connections to peer with each other. Making a gigabit mesh network is a huge challenge, a 100 gigabit one is not practical.Part of the reason is that to get high data rates you need lots of RF bandwidth. 5GHz WiFi barely manages 1 gbit. If you want really high performance you need to look much higher towards 80GHz . However the higher the frequency the worse the penetration of buildings and the more critical the line of sight between highly directional antennas.This is a MonkeyBrains 80 GHz mesh install, it\u2019s $2500 worth of professionally installed equipment. It delivers 300\u2013500 mbit connections to the consumer.",

"Answer": "Mesh networks have been talked about for years/decades, but if they ever replace centralized ISPs I don\u2019t expect it to be in my lifetime or even my sons. The reasons why range from basic physics, to cost, to how traffic flows today based on consumer demand. Now, we can\u2019t change physics so that part of the equation won\u2019t change until/unless we achieve some breakthrough that allows information to move faster than the speed light. Cost on the other hand is something that changes pretty quickly, but the cost differentials what traditional CPE gear costs (at most a couple hundred dollars and often less than fifty) to what aggregation gear costs (several thousand to several hundred thousand) and you can see we\u2019re many orders of magnitude away. What\u2019s worse on the cost front is that as bandwidth usage increases that cost disparity between premise and aggregation gear is actually getting worse instead of moving in the other direction, which is what we\u2019d need to have a mesh network. Traffic patterns could also change, but until we get to a place where content, especially video, is distributed from and/or created in residential dwellings it won\u2019t. Since about 60% of all our traffic is video (mostly licensed and centralized content) I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to change the traffic patterns which is why asymmetrical bandwidth actually works better for most consumers than a symmetrical package does.Lastly IOT will not have any impact on mesh networking. Virtually all IoT connections will run across existing networks in the form of WiFi or cellular networks. The elements inside a home may well form a small mesh network but to get out to the Internet it will use the existing WAN connection in the home or use a cellular connection.",

"Answer": "Yes, when a student is crying in class, a computer will roll up and help the student address the problems they face.When a student starts turning red and itchy from a peanut allergy, the computer is going to react instinctively, taking the child to the nurse.When two students get in an interpersonal conflict, the computer will model good social health, demonstrating methods for de-escalating conflicts and helping the two students act out more appropriate responses to the situation.Yes, when a student asks a question, the computer will be able to understand the student's question and provide a cogent response back. \"Siri, why is the sky blue?\", a simple quesrion, got me back a Wolfram Alpha answer about Rayleigh light scattering effects, and then I reasked the question and got a link to answers .com. I'm sure Yahoo answers is another good source for the questions of the universe.Yes, when a student with a speech impediment asks a question, the computer will have the patience, training, and common sense to know what the child is asking for.Yes, the computer will be able to read books to the student, read with animated gestures and human emotion, and be able to interact with the student's questions and ponderings. \"Look, it's a bird. Yes, we saw a bird last week at recess - you're right. That was a pidgeon, and this book has a blue jay.\" Computers are excellent at making emotive and creative connections between content from different subject areas and fields, amiright?Sorry, I don't think BB8 is that advanced yet. Also, he speaks droid binary. Let's face it, Microsoft Sam doesn't speak great English either...Until then, I will be providing smiles and homework help to my students, pushing them past their excuses, monitoring their health and safety from gas leaks and classroom fires and allergic reactions, helping them with problems before they even admit/recognize they need my help, and providing the warmth and the feeling of a community of learners that a computer or robot could ever provide. For students who lack strong parents, it would be a shame to deprive them of a quality teacher, too. Robots don't solve everything.",

"Answer": "It depends on what area of ML research you do. If you\u2019re not proving things as a major portion of your work, the answer is that in most cases, no, outside of specific niches where it would be useful to understand like Bayesian nonparametrics. If you are proving things, you\u2019ll really be limited if you haven\u2019t studied some amount of measure theory, and these days things like the theory of deep learning seem to borrow heavily from several areas of analysis.Even if you aren\u2019t proving things, sometimes the more theoretical papers, which require you to understand quite a bit of analysis, can be useful for getting ideas. Further, there are two very basic places where measure theory is very useful: pulling a limit (including a derivative) inside an integral, and interchange of integrals. Measure theory gives you (in my opinion) much more intuitive tools for dealing with these than Riemann integration does. So for instance if you want to know whether the derivative of an expectation is equal to the expectation of the derivative, the measure theoretic method of finding a dominating function is often easier than showing uniform convergence.",

"Answer": "As of today, AI and Machine Learning will not directly solve our problems even on a local scale, but it WILL help us reduce many aspects of our problems so they are more manageable.For example: AI + Robotics just performed the first non-human surgery last year. Before, surgeons has to do everything correct in the correct order of operations to ensure nothing goes wrong with the patient. It is very easy, in such a high stress situation to miss some steps or get the wrong order of steps (imagine how many times a waiter will forget something, now imagine everyone you serve\u2019s life is on the line).Now the AI can do these things, it will do it right in the right order every time. If some complication happens in the middle of surgery, human surgeons are standing by to take over, so it didn\u2019t solve the surgery problem completely, but it simplified it and help reduce human errors.Eventually, with AI and probably robotics advancing forward, things like farming, manufacturing can be automated, thus we don\u2019t need farmers and labor workers any more. Domestic work like cleaning, cooking, shopping will also be taken over by robots / AI so people have more free time to enjoy life.Eventually when AI surpasses human intelligence, people no longer need a job. Technology innovation and advancement will be done by AI and robots, people just play all day, or chase your passion without worrying about being a starving artist.",

Radiation Oncologists with implicit interests in physics are deeply involved in the scientific aspects of this specialty as well as venturing into the development and validation of computer-based treatment planning processes and the evolution of new cancer treatment modalities.With your interest in physics, it is very conceivable that you would be accepted into a Radiation Oncology Residency Program and be American Board of Radiology certified as a Radiation Oncologist in 4 years. From there, it would probably be a short jump into an academic career, divided between into research and patient care, probably tenure-tracked along with research grants.But most importantly, the years spent earning the MD degree will not have been wasted and an accommodation made for the interest in physics.",

There were usually a dozen users connected to it.Some successor to the System/370 Model 158, located in the university computing center. The \u201crekencentrum\u201d also had a bunch of these really expensive, great looking, 3270 terminals. The math department where I was studying had a terminal room with ADM-3A terminals that ran a 3270 emulator. Worked just as well and a lot cheaper. This IBM machine easily supported over a hundred simultaneous users.Apart from the big mainframes, I had access to the following single-user machines:I played a little with a Symbolics - Wikipedia Lisp machine. You had to sit behind the console to use it. The math department had a IBM 5100 - Wikipedia for people wanting to use APL.Around the time I got my degree, the computer science department was getting an early generation of SUN workstation - Wikipedia and the math department had gone through several generation Apple, but since they were expensive, people were increasingly getting the Atari ST machines.During my Ph.D. research I did some tests on a CDC Cyber - Wikipedia. My first supercomputer. Of course its performance is absolutely nothing compared to today\u2019s machines.Networking in those days was almost non-existent. You communicated easily with people on the same machine, but networks were not standardized: I used both Bitnet and uucp. Sending data from the science faculty (a Unix shop) to the computing center across the street (an IBM shop) was almost impossible. You could do it (maybe) through a gateway 200 miles away. I connected to the Cyber 205 over a phone line, but moving data was very hard. Easier to mail a magnetic tape, or if I was in a hurry, take it on the train.",

It had a mono chrome monitor with a maximum resolution sufficient to display 80 characters to a line and maybe 25 lines of text, if I remember correctly. The basic disc drive for it would have been a 5&1/4\u2033 floppy disc drive. (It is the image of a floopy disc that is commonly used as the \u2018save file\u2019 icon today.) that could store 100K of data. I think I upgraded to a top of the range double sided double density drive good for close to 400K and a pair of ram drives good for 250K each. So close to 1Mb of storage capacity as long as you kept the ram drives on. Turn them of by accident and all their data was gone. No recovery options at all.( If you want more details try here. BBC Micro - Wikipedia )If your first computer was a netbook, or a tablet or you have a smart phone I doubt I can convey to you just how limited the model B was..These days most of the emails I receive are larger than 32K and the BBC\u2019s 32K had to store the operating system and image for the monitor display which left precious little space for user data.So you\u2019re probably thinking the thing was useless. And you would be wrong.First, you could buy software programmes including simple word processors, ( roughly the equivalent of a basic text editor) , on rom chips. So while the programs were very limited, they loaded in a couple of seconds. ( How long does it take for MS word to load on your machine? ) You could do basic accounting, write letters, essays, reports, produce simple graphs and charts. As long as the individual document didn\u2019t exceed about 8K in size, or about 1000 words. You could do all the paperwork for a small business on it just fine. And what I used to love about it was the upside of that really basic operating system, - it powered up instantly. You turned it on and it was ready to go. As fast as turning on a TV today.So why do I bother mentioning all this. Two reasons.The first I have already touched on. Simplicity meant speed. Something that the makers of the BBC micros certain seemed to have appreciated for themselves. And in case you don\u2019t know, the BBC microcomputer were made by Acorn Acorn Computers - Wikipedia who went on the design their own RISC chips. And from Acorn came Arm Ltd. ARM Holdings - Wikipedia. And you might not know the name, but chances are you are using several of their chips designs right now.Which brings me nicely to my second point. Thirty years ago as I used my BBC I had no concept of just how far computing technology would develop in my life time. Can you imagine where computing will be in thirty years time?",

"Answer": "Reverse engineering is examining a known thing and working out how to make something that will do what it does in whatever way is easy.Artificial Intelligence is reverse engineering where our brains are the known thing and the goal is to have a computer do what it does.Reverse engineering does not mean you know how something works. Only that you can figure out how to do the same thing in some way that works.We do not know how our brains work but we invented math tools which we can use to get similar results. Rather than trying for everything the brain can do, it is better to attack the problem in pieces. What is in play when we make decisions? How do we recognize people, characters, patterns?There are now computers with their programs that can find important relationships between streams of data. Also, make choices based on what it finds in data. Also, work out solutions to problems and plan a sequence of actions for achieving an intended result. Recognizing patterns and matching them to known shapes, even faces. Translating speech or text from one language to another. What are the symptoms of a disease? When is a stock about to go up/or down?In one sense, a collection of methods for imitating how the brain responds to challenges is a hodge-podge. That would be the case except there is much to be learned as various challenges are met. Artificial Intelligence as a field collects and organizes various advances as a coherent body of knowledge.",

"Answer": "Those are some smart five year olds, understanding those big words (anything bigger than 5 letters). I\u2019m going to try to explain it to myself when I was 5 years old. I think this might be a real conversation between me and my son when he gets older.5 year old me: \u201cWhat\u2019s AI?\u201d (I get down to business).30s me: \u201cIt\u2019s when people want to make machines think and learn on its own. So one day it will help us solve problems we cannot solve ourselves\u201d.5 me: \u201cHow can we make it think and learn?\u201d30s me: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know exactly, but we are trying to figure it out. We try to see how people think and learn, for example by using our brain, so we try to build a \u201cbrain\u201d for machines.\u201d5 me: \u201cHow do brains work?\u201d30s me: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that either. We think we have a lot of things in the brain that are linked, like people forming lines, many many lines that crisscross all over the place. Then someone starts pushing the person in front of them, then that person pushes the person in front of them, so the entire line is pushing. Sometimes, you have a big strong person in line, so he/she pushes harder and make everyone after that pushes harder, sometimes you meet a kid in line so the kid pushes with a really light force, the person in front might push with a light force or stop pushing at all (they don\u2019t feel it).At the end of these lines, there are walls of buttons. One line have buttons that says Happy, Sad, etc, another line will have buttons like 10, 20, 100, etc. So when the last person in line 1 falls over, he/she will end up pushing the happy button (that person has no control because the person behind might push him/her towards the left or right side, with strong or weak force). The second line, the last person is being pushed towards one direction and ends up pushing 100. So now you are really really happy.In the brain, what pushes the lines are the light we see, sound we hear, feelings we touch, smells, etc. In a computer, we the researchers push the line, and we determine how hard to push and on which lines.\u201d5 me: \u201cHow does it learn then?\u201d30s me: \u201cIn a human brain, let\u2019s say you see a red circle on the stove. What happens is line 1 pushes saw red stove button, line 2 pushes touch button, now you touch the stove. The heat from our hand pushes line 1 and says PAIN, and line 2 says 100000, your brain will say \u2018Hey line 2, next time line 1 pushes saw red stove, STOP pushing the TOUCH button, push the NO TOUCH button\u201d.In a computer, we force line one to push \u201csaw red stove\u201d button, and see what button line 2 pushes (it\u2019s just random people lining up, they really like to push things). When we see that line 2 pushes the TOUCH button, we say \u201cHey, why does the last person in line fall to the left, because the TOUCH button is on the left side?\u201d, we look at the person before because he/she is pushing the last person to the left, well the person before is also push left and so on, eventually we found some guy in the middle, he started pushing everyone to the left because his left arm is too strong (I know it\u2019s right arm too strong to push left, but let\u2019s not get into another explanation inside explanation), so I tell him, get out of the line, and YOU with both arms equally strong, replace him. Now we force line 1 to push the \u201csaw red stove\u201d button again, and line 2 this time falls forward and pushes the \u201cNO TOUCH\u201d button.Do you want ice cream? (to distract him from asking further questions).\u201d5 me: \u201cSounds complicated, and no, I don\u2019t eat ice cream, I\u2019m a good kid!\u201d30s me: \u201cHa, who are you fooling, I\u2019m YOU remember?\u201d5 me: \u201c\u2026oh yeah, ok, bring the bucket.\u201d",

It\u2019s mostly because a back-end is developed once and maintained after, as for the front-end it can change constantly.I\u2019ve worked in small and big teams and I would never say one is more valuable than the other. Both have their importance and both should be able to respect each other jobs.Even if it was said as a joke, the back-end developer just depreciated you.",

"Answer": "Each side has its challenging problems to be solved. It depends on your interest/focus to choose a proper position or tasks. In my case, I can do both sides, but I like web front-end things at the moment (thanks to the evolution of React.js and it's ecosystem). So, I lost my interests on backend stuff, and leave them to my peers who enjoy doing backend development than me.However, my ultimate goal is creating apps which have superb UI/UX & high performance (fast, responsiveness, memory efficient) for the end-users. Therefore, no matter it\u2019s front or backend, you still have to organize the codebase well, use practical and efficient algorithms with proper data structures to solve complex problems if you share the same goal with me.I believe great backend is nothing if you don't have a good enough front-end to attract the users or make them come back again. \"Good enough backend + good front-end\" is always better than \"great backend + horrible front-end\". Look Facebook, YouTube, Medium, Messenger,\u2026 their backend is awesome, but they still invest heavily in front-end to improve UI/UX, because at the end of the day, their users must feel happy to continue using their services day by day :) Think about using an iPhone 7 Plus which has Android 2.3's UI/UX :D",

"Answer": "As a back end developer, I may be able to give a different perspective, well kind of.First off your back end developer was wrong! Completely and utterly wrong! It doesn\u2019t matter how amazing my infrastructure is, or how brilliant my code analyzes the data, if it isn\u2019t formatted in a way that the user can interpret it, it is useless.I work in a very small dev department of a mid size company, so occasionally I will have a project that I need to build start to finish by myself. There is a specific one I did a few years back that stands out. It was a program that could analyze how profitable each salesman was to the company. At the time our company had nothing like it, and for me it was a big coding milestone, I had rarely had the opportunity to build out such complex structures. I spent the better part of a month building out the structure, then because time was scarce, and I had already \u201cfinished\u201d the important part, I spent about a day building out the front end. To me the beauty and value lied solely in the numbers, the numbers were amazing! I then presented the project to the owner of the company, he hated it! He couldn\u2019t understand what it was doing, nor what any of the numbers even meant. I learned the hard way that day that without good design, and better UI no one cares what happens behind the scenes.Another example, my company uses salesforce extensively with everything we build. It is integrated in almost every product I make. Last year, my boss came with us to Dreamforce (salesforce\u2019s conference) and on the first day he started talking to the salesforce people about a new product called the \u201cfinancial service cloud\u201d. He was in love, he was convinced it would completely change the way we do business. The next day I spent a few hours talking to their developers about this product, I couldn\u2019t figure out why my boss liked it so much. Technically it did nothing for us, it wouldn\u2019t take anything off of my plate, it was worthless. Because the boss is the boss, we ended up getting it anyways, and the response has been better than I could have imagined. All of the sales guys love it, solely because it looks better!To conclude, to me the most important person on my team is my front end guy! Without him no one would understand the cool things I have built, nor would they ever get used by anyone who isn\u2019t forced to. But because I have a great front end guy, I can spend my days happily building systems, without having to work on the tediousness of how it is supposed to be displayed.",

You're on the same team, with the same objective: build a product that the users find functional and pleasant to use.The front-end guy is going to help pull in users with pleasant layout and nice interactions and animations and such that work across a range of browsers and devices. That's where the users most tangibly touch your application.But, if the application takes off, and people flock to your site, it's those dedicated backend guys that are going to prevent things from crashing and bogging down under the load as 1000 users becomes millions of users. And prevent the users' information and credit card details from getting stolen. All the nice layout and CSS and JavaScript in the world won't save your world if those things are not tended to.So hold hands and sing kumbaya.

"Answer": "True or not that does not matter in private sector, and of course depends on product.One can not exist without the other. Someone need to do the work, on both end. \u201ctechnical value \u201c is a subjective and worthless term (from my point of view) if you are not building something new, or work in research.If a product/feature is not working properly then it's useless. Period.I am a backend developer working mostly with distributed data structure. I have few features waiting for damn UI. So all of that might have higher \u201ctechnical value\u201d but its useless in reality, good for nothing.I once only added new relations between 3 set of data, improved performance. UI did a good job to present them.Oh suddenly we got the feedback that our customers love this. Become one of the most valuable feature in product according to Productmanager and sells. Hurray\u2026\u2026So \u201ctechnical value\u201d is really not worth a dime sometimes, but presentation ALWAYS matters. If you are not working in research. (Even there you need to present your results)",

"Answer": "You both seem to have a narrow vision and cannot seem to think outside of your main tech stack.This is a bad place to be in. In your case, I would suggest learning more about what you are unfamiliar with\u2026 there is more to programming than adjusting layouts and programming in your framework of choice (network prog, backend, native mobile, FP, algorithms, the list goes on and on\u2026).The same can be said of your colleague. There is an ungodly amount of difficulties to master on the frontend (5+ different js bundlers in common use, angular/react and the other million or so frontend frameworks, js/typescript/ coffee (not to mention other languages)).",

"Answer": "Actually, as for front end code, it may be of less technical value.But, it has greater marketing value.The question of code longevity might come up. And, you will probably figure that the front end code will be replaced fairly frequently. If the back end code has a useful, good architecture, it may last a long time doing the business processes of the company.Since front end code is more likely to change, it might be better that is done more cheaply. In other words, tweaking CSS a lot would be of less and less value as the tweaking progreses. It pays to get a simple and effective front end working quickly. If the front end code can abstract beyond its rendering technique, it might be of greater value. For instance, if you can anticipate the extinction of HTML and still create front ends to fit the brand within your presentation architecture given new underlying presentation tools, then your work will last longer doing the marketing job for the company.It may be easy for a back end engineer to say that his work is worth more only because he instinctively understands that there are more components with intrinsic longevity. But, they can\u2019t really put down the work of the front end.I know for one that I would rather work on the processes behind the site rather than the presentation. The presentation is more like the job a graphic artist. I don\u2019t have the patients for that battles fought on this ground. I am not excited about arguing over colors or the look of a page on different devices. Having done some of that though, I can understand the challenges of a long lasting full stack development. And, I would rather build a platform which will allow the artists the opportunity to make many revisions needed for their game. As such, I always think that it would be good to hire an artist.So, if I can see the reason to hire an artist for front end work, I can\u2019t see the reason to suggest that their work isn\u2019t worth much. Rather, I would like to let them know that I understand the high value of what the produce for the sake of selling the business and its message.",

"Answer": "Front and back must complement each other, and neither one is more or less important. Backend is useless if the frontend is not done well.Frontend IS tedious work, some backend folks may not neccessarily have the patience to focus on details at that level.Frontend folks are expected to deliver user interface and user experience that are pleasing to the clients/customers/users whom aren\u2019t always technical savvy. That, in of itself, is highly technical.I work with both frontend and backend on a daily basis. I have tremendous respect for people who can do beautiful frontend work and deliver awesome user experience. And I think the backend person who made that criticism is full of it.",

"Answer": "The backend developer doesn\u2019t know what he is saying.As a developer who works on both, I can tell you that backend development is quite dull in a lot of cases, and produces results most people won\u2019t understand. They also won\u2019t care about it unless it\u2019s slow or broken. The end user is focused on what is in front of them, the user interface.Also, the more you know about the front end, the less work that actually has to be done on the backend. In HTML5 and modern browsers and leveraging AJAX, JSON, and other technologies like AngularJS, complex work can be done on the front end, only retrieving minimal information from the server.A good developer that knows both the front and the backend can create an API layer that minimizes the back end work, improves scalability and performance, and has a responsive user interface.Both have the same \u2018technical value\u2019 and this fellow is simply arrogant and ill-informed or is seeking to diminish the work someone else does because he needs to bolster his self-importance.",

"Answer": "He is right. All of the works of front end developers are just aboutNothing science about those. You must know how/where to copy the right things and paste to the right places.Modern frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and new tools such as NodeJS, npm, Browserify, Babelify just make people to learn more, type more and copy/paste more, and add some colorful runnings in the terminal. Nothing interesting about them.And using NodeJS to run javascript server side code is purely stupid and pathetic.So yes, front end development nowadays is tedious, boring work, not engineering work. But it is necessary though, because we still need to build web-based interfaces for applications.However, don\u2019t kid people and don\u2019t kid yourself that front end work nowadays is software development.

"Answer": "I'm a \u201cfull stack\" dev at a company that tries very hard to compartmentalize. I can tell you that the achritects have a lot of opinions about front end development but they don't really know shit about it. They also make descions that trickle down regarding front end that they shouldn't have anything to do with.If scaling your application is such a big deal than it probably wasn't designed well. These days with cloud tech and all the techniques for loose coupling and sharding that exist, they're probably not thinking too hard.Front end frameworks change at a blistering rate and many of the popular ones require OOP knowledge and adherence to design patterns. As a full stack dev, personally I feel that back end is the same ol stuff over and over and I have a lot to learn when it comes to front end. I find it exciting and I enjoy working with what the human at the other end will be interfacing with.",
